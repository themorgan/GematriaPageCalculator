"""precedent_sync_views.py — one command for a CONSUMING repo to refresh its
own generated AGENTS.md loader block from every source it resolves
(universal + team + individual + repo-local), instead of remembering to run
tools/precedent_materialize.py and then tools/build_views.py --agents-only
separately, with matching --repo/--out arguments each time.

This is glue over two already-existing, independently tested tools, not a
new mechanism:

  1. tools/precedent_materialize.py — resolve() every declared source
     (precedent_resolve.py) and write the merged practices/ + tools/checks/
     into the target repo, plus each source's declared harness adapters
     (its `bootstrap/*.sh` into this repo's `.claude/hooks/`), refusing an
     over-budget resident set, a tools/checks/ filename collision across
     sources, or a malformed or colliding adapter declaration.
  2. tools/build_views.py's build_loader_block() (the SAME renderer this
     repo uses on its own single-source catalogue) — fed the resolved
     practices directly from step 1's in-memory result, not re-read from
     disk, so this never risks parsing something materialize() just wrote
     differently than materialize() itself understood it.

What this tool does NOT do: generate MAP.md or GLOSSARY.md (those assume
this repo's own structure — see build_views.py's --agents-only, which this
tool always uses the equivalent of), or vendor the engine scripts
themselves (precedent_resolve.py, precedent_materialize.py, build_views.py,
precedent_show.py, precedent_paths.py, precedent_gate.py, split_practices.py
all need to already be sitting together in the consuming repo's own tools/
— INSTALL.md's existing vendoring model, or cloning/copying this repo's
tools/, same as precedent_materialize.py's own docstring already says).

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo DIR [--user-config PATH] [--check]

  --repo is REQUIRED and names the consuming repo's root; from that root it
  is `--repo .`. It used to default to this script's own directory's parent,
  which is right only when the script is vendored at the consuming repo's own
  tools/ beside precedent_resolve.py, and wrong wherever else it is nested —
  a `process/upstream/tools/` mirror most of all, since that copy exists for
  the audit tools rather than this one.

  The default was documented as a trap right here and went on catching
  people anyway: 2026-09-09, a careful session ran it bare from a consuming
  repo, --repo resolved to `process/upstream/`, the shared sources' `../` paths
  then resolved against `process/`, every one of them missed, and the run
  hard-failed claiming the universal source's path collided with its own
  output directory. Nothing was wrong with that repo. A documented trap that
  still catches a reader is an argument for a refusal, not for a better
  paragraph (practice: checkable-gets-checked), so there is no default now.

Exit: 0 on a clean sync, 1 on anything precedent_materialize.py or the
resident-budget check would themselves exit 1 on (a resolve conflict, a
tools/checks/ filename collision, an over-budget resident set, a bad harness
adapter declaration), or on --check finding drift.

    # changed. "The tree differs from the plan" is true constantly and means
    # nothing on its own. "This repository committed a catalogue containing
    # rule X, and X is about to be gone" is a much narrower claim, and it is
    # the one worth refusing on.
    #
    # Four things fall out of using that baseline, each closing one of the
    # false positives that killed the first attempt:
    #   * No committed MANIFEST.json -- a scratch fixture, a fresh install,
    #     an uncommitted experiment -- and there is no baseline, so this does
    #     not apply. It cannot fire on a repo that has never published a
    #     catalogue.
    #   * A WITHHELD slug is excluded: a public repo keeps private-level text
    #     out of its tracked tree deliberately, and those practices still
    #     bind through .precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md.
    #   * A slug whose recorded SOURCE NAME IS NOT AMONG THE DECLARED ONES
    #     is refused too, since 2026-09-14. It used to be reported and
    #     written, on the reasoning that dropping a source from
    #     precedent.json is a decision somebody just made on purpose -- true
    #     of a drop, and false of a RENAME, which looks identical here
    #     because the match is by name. The refusal names all three states it
    #     cannot separate; --allow-removals proceeds.
    #   * A slug whose recorded source IS STILL DECLARED, and which that
    #     source no longer produces, is the real case: the rule moved or the
    #     vendored copy went stale, and syncing now loses it. That is the
    #     2026-09-07 incident -- promoting two practices out of a shared set
    #     left every consumer pinned before the promotion with them in
    #     neither source.
