"""practice_audit.py — audit the practice-export layer
(practice: practice-export-loop; practice: scrub-gate; practice: layered-practice-packs).

Runs from a dependent repo (script lives at process/upstream/tools/). A repo
may install several practice layers ("packs" -- (practice: layered-practice-packs)): the generic
upstream at process/upstream/ tracked by process/manifest.json, plus any
domain packs vendored at process/<pack>/ tracked by process/manifest_<pack>.json.
This audit discovers every process/manifest*.json and runs the same three
checks against each manifest's own vendored tree — any FAIL exits non-zero:

  1. SCRUB (the leakage gate). Every text file under the manifest's
     upstream.vendored_at tree is scanned against that manifest's blocklist:
     upstream.scrub_blocklist if the key is present (a JSON null explicitly
     opts the pack out, with a notice), else the default
     process/scrub_blocklist.txt. Any hit FAILS: a vendored tree destined
     for another repo must be clean at all times, not just at check-in. A
     configured blocklist file that does not exist on disk FAILS — a
     configured-but-missing blocklist is a check that did not run, not a
     pass; only an explicit `scrub_blocklist: null` skips the check.

  2. DRIFT (baseline snapshots, practice: registry-source-of-truth). For each manifest entry with
     granularity "file": the local file's sha256 is compared to the recorded
     local_sha256 baseline. Changed while status is "synced" → FAIL — the
     local improvement must be exported to the vendored tree and re-baselined
     (--update-baseline), or the entry deliberately flipped to "diverged"
     (then it is listed as pending export, not failed). This exists because
     "copy changes back" as a prose rule is exactly the kind of convention
     that gets skipped under pressure.

  3. INTEGRITY. Manifest and upstream paths exist; "section"-granularity
     entries' section_marker still occurs in local_path (warn-only — section
     tracking is approximate by design); "local-only" entries carry notes.

  4. LAYOUT (root hygiene). Upstream-internal docs (INSTALL.md,
     PRACTICES.md, SETUP.md, ...) must not sit at the dependent repo's
     root — they belong only inside a vendored tree such as
     process/upstream/. A contributor browsing the root should see the
     project's own subject matter plus the instantiated files, nothing
     about BestPractice internals. A root file with one of these names
     FAILS unless a manifest records it as this repo's own document (an
     entry with that local_path). Runs once per audit, with exceptions
     collected across all manifests.

  5. LOADER (the catalogue is actually in force). A repo that vendors the
     practice catalogue (process/upstream/practices/) must also run the
     loader over it: precedent.json declares a `level: "universal"` source,
     and the root instructions file carries the generated loader block.
     Either missing FAILS. Without both, every vendored practice is text on
     disk that no session ever reads -- no resident block, no occasion
     index, no gates -- while the install looks complete and this audit,
     until 2026-09-23, passed. That is the classic INSTALL.md section 1
     install, retired that day as an install path: a real consumer ran it
     for a day, took an update, and its sessions reported the rules as "a
     vendored copy of the upstream catalogue, not something this repo
     adopted". The remedy is the migration, never an exemption: there is
     deliberately no flag or manifest key that silences this check.

  6. DECLINED (a decline covers the text it was made against, practice:
     current-rule-governs). An entry with status "declined" records an
     upstream practice this repo chose not to take, with the sha256 of the
     upstream file as it stood then (declined_upstream_sha256) and the
     reason in notes. When the vendored upstream file has changed since, or
     is gone, the decline no longer covers the rule in force and this FAILS
     until somebody decides again: adopt it, or keep declining and record
     the new hash with --redecide NAME. --update-baseline never does that for
     you, because re-baselining a decline unread is the failure this check
     exists for. Incident, 2026-09-24: a consumer declined upstream's
     merge-keyword practice as a "duplicate" of a personal rule; upstream
     then replaced it with a broader one, two later syncs carried the
     decline forward unread, and a session refused a command the rule in
     force plainly authorized.

  7. PROSE DECLINES (warn only). Check 6 can only see a decline recorded in
     a manifest. A decline written as prose in AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md ("we
     declined X as a duplicate", "the personal pack wins on conflict") has
     no hash to compare, so this names each such line outside the generated
     loader block for a person to review: keep it if it still holds against
     the rules in force, record a decline in the manifest, or delete it.
     It is a guess from wording, which is why it warns and never fails.

  8. THE ENGINE IS VENDORED WHERE A REFRESH CAN REACH IT. A repo can run
     the loader (check 5 passes) with its engine sitting only under
     process/upstream/tools/ and no tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json -- the
     migration stopped before its step 7. Then "Update Vendors" has nothing
     to run `refresh` with, so no engine fix, hook fix or cleanup of the old
     install's leftovers ever reaches it. Measured 2026-09-24 in one of six
     installs, still carrying both retired workflows. FAILS until the
     migration is finished (spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md step 7).
