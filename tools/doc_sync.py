"""doc_sync -- keep script-generated blocks inside documents in sync (practice: computed-numbers-in-scripts).

The failure mode this kills: a script that computes numbers (a model, a cost
rollup) changes, and a document quoting those numbers silently keeps the old
ones -- someone has to notice and ask "did you update the table?". Instead,
any document region whose content a script computes is wrapped in invisible
sentinels:

    <!--gen:NAME-->
    ...generated markdown (typically a table)...
    <!--/gen:NAME-->

and the (document, NAME, script) triple is registered in PAIRS below. The
script must support `--emit NAME`, printing exactly the block's content.

    python3 tools/doc_sync.py           # gate: fail loudly on drift
    python3 tools/doc_sync.py --write   # regenerate blocks in place
    python3 tools/doc_sync.py --list    # show registered pairs

Run the bare command with the repo's other pre-commit gates. When a document
gains a script-generated table: wrap it in sentinels, give the script an
`--emit NAME` mode, register the pair. Never hand-edit inside a gen block --
the numbers live in the script; the document is a render target.

The sentinels are HTML comments, which render as nothing on hosted markdown.

THE LEDGER (host knob LEDGER). Re-running every emitter to see whether its
block still matches is the gate's whole cost, and most of it is spent
proving that nothing changed. With a ledger, each block carries a fact:
the fingerprint of the code its emitter can reach (reach_key.py, the same
engine that keys memos), the hashes of the files the emit actually read
(recorded by an audit hook in the emit process), and the hash of what it
printed. A block whose fact still holds on all three is skipped without
running anything; only the rest are emitted. Facts verify themselves, so
the ledger merges by union and a stale or foreign line costs one re-emit,
never a skipped block. An emit whose reads could not be recorded gets no
fact and always runs. `--full` ignores the ledger.

    python3 tools/doc_sync.py --full    # emit every block regardless

Beyond the drift gate, this tool enforces two things a generated block alone
cannot: a provenance footer naming the scripts that feed each document, and
the practice-33 RESTATEMENT check -- a figure a script declares it owns
(owned_figures()) must not be hand-typed into the prose around its block,
because that copy has no gate on it and silently survives a fix to the script.

# LIVE `git fetch`/`ls-remote` against the real GitHub origin, so its
# answer depends on the moment it runs and the clone's own depth, not on
# anything this repository's own commit fixes. Registering it here failed
# the very first CI run (practice: very-deep-check): the harness's own
# "enforced channel fires" self-test builds a scratch copy of the tree to
# plant one violation, and that copy's git history and remote are not the
# real repo's, so the live scan inside it produced a different answer than
# whatever was committed -- a false DRIFT with no connection to the
# planted violation being tested. `tools/very_deep_check.py` writes that
# block directly, with its own sentinel, when its checkout branch scan
# actually runs -- see `_update_spec_doc_block()` -- the same way it writes
# record/stale_branches.md, never gated on matching a moment that has
