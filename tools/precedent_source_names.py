"""precedent_source_names.py -- answers one question a git command cannot:
is every practice-source repository this repo declares still CALLED what this
repo calls it?

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND THE INCIDENT THAT PRODUCED IT (practice:
cite-the-incident). A shared source was renamed on GitHub. A consuming repo
went on declaring it, cloning it, attaching it and materializing from it
under the OLD name, with every check green, for an unknown number of
sessions. Nothing failed, and nothing could have: GitHub redirects a renamed
repository indefinitely, so `git clone` succeeds, `git ls-remote` succeeds,
the sibling clone resolves, and the practices materialize correctly. The
CONTENT is right. Only the name is a ghost -- and every reference to it in
every vendored tree is one repository-settings change away from a 404 that
nobody can date. It surfaced on 2026-09-11 because a person recognised a
name he had retired, which is not a mechanism (practice:
convention-to-audit).

spec/SOURCE_NAMING.md predicted this in as many words -- the repository name
is the one of its four names where "nothing breaks immediately; a later
rename breaks every vendored reference". This is the part of that row that
can be mechanised: not preventing the rename, which no engine can do, but
noticing it afterwards instead of never.

WHAT ACTUALLY ANSWERS IT. Not git, which is exactly the problem: every git
operation follows the redirect silently and reports success. GitHub's REST
API carries the repository's CURRENT `full_name` in the response BODY, and
that is what this reads -- never the status code, never the final URL.
Measured 2026-09-11 in this container against a repository this session
could reach:

    GET /repos/alex137/bestpractice   -> 200, full_name "alex137/BestPractice"
    GET /repos/ALEX137/BESTPRACTICE   -> 200, full_name "alex137/BestPractice"

so the body carries the canonical name whether the request was redirected or
merely spelled differently, and reading the body makes the redirect question
irrelevant to correctness. The 301 a genuine rename returns WAS unverified
here until 2026-09-14, when a session measured it against a source
repository renamed three days earlier and found that the tool reported it
UNVERIFIED -- the one input it exists to recognise. api_full_name's
docstring carries the measurement; the fix is to stop following the
redirect, because the redirect itself is the answer.

The whole tool was run end to end against that same repository on the same
day, through a fixture source whose clone fetched `alex137/bestpractice`: it
reported SPELLING, naming `alex137/BestPractice`, plus the offline DRIFT row
below. A rename differs from that only in how far the two names diverge.

WHY IT IS NOT A precedent_check.py CHECK. Every check there is offline by
construction -- it runs in CI, in a bare checkout, on a plane. This one needs
the network and a credential for a private source, and a check that answers
"could not run" on most of the runs that invoke it teaches people to ignore
the gate (practice: checkable-gets-checked). It is wired instead into the one
moment a session is already online and already reconciling its sources: the
`Update Vendors` sequence (practice: vendor-update-runbook, step 8).

THE FAILURE THIS IS BUILT NOT TO HAVE. "Could not check" and "checked, the
name is current" must never render the same (practice: fail-gracefully). A
source whose API answer did not arrive is UNVERIFIED and says why; it is
never OK, and --check does not fail on it either -- a vendor update must not
be blocked by an unreachable network, and a person who reads UNVERIFIED knows
they have not been told the name is fine.

ONE ENVIRONMENT NOTE THAT WILL OTHERWISE READ AS A RENAME. In a hosted Claude
Code session, api.github.com answers **403** with a body naming `add_repo` for
every repository the session has not attached -- not 404. So "this repo does
not exist" and "this session may not ask" are indistinguishable from the
status code alone, and this tool reports both as UNVERIFIED with the body's
own words rather than guessing. Measured 2026-09-11.

A NAME THE SESSION READ FROM GITHUB ANOTHER WAY. Attaching a public set
with push access is how a hosted session lets this tool ask the API, and
the auto-mode classifier can refuse that attach as a permission grant (2 of
3 refused, 2026-09-30, from a consumer's Update Vendors). The session can
still list the repositories its account reaches -- `list_repos`, whose
`full_name` is GitHub's current name, a rename included -- and pass each one
with `--canonical OWNER/NAME`. A source whose API answer did not arrive is
then OK when the list carries its name exactly, SPELLING when only the case
differs, and stays UNVERIFIED when the list does not carry it: a name absent
from the list may have moved, or may be out of the account's reach, and
the list cannot say which. Where the API did answer, the API's answer wins.

    Reads `full_name` out of the response BODY. The status code says only
    that an answer came back; the body says what the repository is called
    now.

    `renamed` is True only when GitHub answered a REDIRECT for this name,
    which is conclusive on its own: a repository still called that does not
    redirect. Reporting the rename is the job; recovering the new name is a
    detail, and the two are separated here because the second one fails in
    the field while the first does not.

    Measured 2026-09-14 against `themorgan/precedent-team-maintainers`, a
    source repository genuinely renamed three days earlier -- the case the
    module docstring used to record as unreachable and therefore untested.
    GitHub answers 301 with `Location: .../repositories/<numeric id>`, and
    `urlopen` follows redirects by default, so the tool used to make a second
    request that some proxies refuse outright (403: "Numeric-ID repository
    paths are not supported through this proxy"). It then caught the
    HTTPError and reported UNVERIFIED -- "could not check" -- on precisely
    the input the tool exists to recognise, and `--check` exited 0.

    CONFIRMED IN THE FIELD the same day, after the fix landed, by a session
    that held BOTH names at once -- it had attached that source before the
    rename and re-attached it after. Running the shipped code against four
    real inputs: the renamed repository under its OLD name (RENAMED, carrying
    the 301), the same repository under its CURRENT name (OK, with the right
    `full_name`), an unrenamed source (OK), and a repository that does not
    exist (UNVERIFIED, a different message, not confused for a rename).
    **Reproducing that needs both names attached at once**, which only a
    session straddling the rename has; from anywhere else the API answers 403
    for the old name. A 403 on a re-run is an attachment state, not a
    regression here -- the two are indistinguishable from the status code, as
    the module docstring's environment note already says.
