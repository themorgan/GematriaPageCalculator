"""checkin.py — drive the periodic check-in (INSTALL.md §4) mechanically.

Runs from a dependent repo (script lives at process/upstream/tools/). The
check-in loop — sync the vendored tree into a clone of the upstream repo,
land it there, then record the landed commit in the manifest — was performed
by hand several times and each pass repeated the same steps with the same
two failure modes: forgetting the scrub before content left the private
repo, and recording a hash that didn't actually match the tree that landed.
Per the convention-becomes-audit rule, the steps are now a tool; every
mutation it performs is gated by a check that fails loudly.

Four subcommands — update takes upstream changes IN, the other three drive
a check-in OUT. Each takes `--source NAME` to run the same loop for a SHARED
practice set that ships code (practice: source-naming, 2026-09-18): the
vendored tree is then process/<name>/, the manifest process/manifest_<name>.json,
and only the directories the set's own precedent-source.json lists under
`code` are mirrored; its practices resolve live and are never vendored.
Without --source the universal set is mirrored whole, as always.

Each also takes `--repo PATH`: the consuming repo to act on, instead of the
repo this file sits in (2026-09-27). It lets the SOURCE clone's current copy
of this tool update a consumer, which is how tools/precedent_update.py runs
it -- the consumer's own vendored copy lives inside the very catalogue it is
updating, so a fix to it would otherwise reach a repo only after that repo
had already needed it.

  status <upstream-clone>   Compare the vendored tree against the clone's
                            working tree: list Added/Modified/Deleted files
                            (vendored perspective), show the manifest's
                            recorded upstream.commit vs the clone's HEAD.
                            Exit 1 if the trees differ (so it can gate).

  update <upstream-clone> [--force] [--allow-pinned]
                            The INSTALL.md §2 direction: mirror the clone's
                            tree, at the branch THIS install tracks
                            (manifest `upstream.branch`, else the clone's
                            default), into the vendored tree. Reads the
                            clone with `git archive` -- never checks it out,
                            pulls in it, or moves its HEAD.
                            REFUSES while `upstream.branch` names a branch
                            other than the clone's default: that is
                            spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md's pinned-
                            branch hold, and the remedy is a one-off manual
                            mirror (override for one run with --allow-pinned,
                            or the equivalent PRECEDENT_ALLOW_PINNED_UPDATE=1
                            -- prefer the flag: the env var's name reads as a
                            safety-bypass pattern to at least one harness's
                            own permission classifier, which refuses it
                            before checkin.py ever runs).
                            Also REFUSES if the vendored tree differs from
                            the recorded upstream.commit — that difference
                            is unexported local work the mirror would
                            silently clobber; export it first (§3/§4) or
                            pass --force to overwrite. (Origin: a session
                            hand-rolled this mirror with git archive | tar
                            — rsync is absent in hosted containers, as of
                            2026-08 — and a stale local default-branch ref
                            nearly mirrored an old tree; the tool pulls
                            fresh and guards the overwrite.)

  rules [REF]               In the repo that ships the copy: each file
                            added since REF (default: the landing branch)
                            and whether it ships to consumers, by the
                            VENDORING_RULES rule that decides it. Exit 1
                            if a file has no rule.

  push <upstream-clone> --why "what went wrong"
                            Send this repo's committed changes to the
                            vendored tree upstream, as a branch in the
                            clone: tools/precedent_local_edits.py send
                            merges each file three ways onto upstream's
                            landing branch (so upstream work since the
                            mirror is never reverted), runs this repo's
                            scrub and upstream's leak gate and basic tier,
                            commits, and pushes the branch -- never a pull
                            request, never a merge -- then prints the prompt
                            for the session that lands it. With --source,
                            a shared set's code tree still takes the old
                            mirror into the clone's working tree.

  record <upstream-clone> [--note "..."] [--resolving PATH ...]
                            After the upstream merge: pull the clone's
                            default branch, verify it is byte-identical to
                            the vendored tree (fail loudly if not — never
                            record a hash that doesn't match the tree), then
                            write the clone's HEAD hash into
                            process/manifest.json upstream.commit. Commit
                            the manifest change in the dependent repo
                            yourself. --resolving names a file (relative
                            to the vendored tree) whose local edit Update
                            Vendors is resolving itself; the carry check
                            skips exactly those, and says how many.

  fresh                    Clone-free staleness notice for session starts:
                            one `git ls-remote` of the manifest's upstream
                            repo, compared to the recorded upstream.commit.
                            Prints one line only when upstream has moved;

                            stays silent on network failure — detection is
                            automated, taking the update stays deliberate
                            (INSTALL.md sec.2).

# Directories that exist in BestPractice and have no business in a dependent

# a question about BUILDING Precedent, not about using it, and nothing a
# consumer runs reads any of it (checked across both real consumers,
# 2026-09-06: the only mention outside the vendored tree is a comment in
# precedent_check.py). Every session in every consuming repo was cloning,
# scanning and scrubbing it for nothing.
#
# NOTE, because this reads like a deletion and is not: nothing here removes a
# PRACTICE. Practices live in practices/ and every one of them still vendors.
# This excludes measurement fixtures only.
#
# The share it accounts for is measured, never typed: `python3
# tools/checkin.py not-vendored` prints it against the tree in front of you.
# An earlier version of this comment froze the figures inline and they were
# stale within a day, which is the same rot that practice
# `computed-numbers-in-scripts` exists to stop -- in prose it is a gate, and in
# a code comment nothing checks it at all, so the honest form is a command the
# reader can run.
#
# Excluded from the comparison, so an existing consumer that already has the
# directory simply stops being told it drifted; deleting the stale copy is
# the consumer's own next re-vendor, not something this tool reaches in and
# does.
# `philosophy/` is the second entry, added 2026-09-14 after Morgan read the
# vendoring instructions and asked why it was in them at all: it is the
# argument FOR the ideas Precedent implements -- essays, notes, rules being
# tried -- and it is neither part of the system nor instructions for using it.
# The repo already says so in two places and had not joined them up:
# local/practices/philosophy-is-not-repo-policy.md says philosophy/ binds
# nothing outside itself, and spec/DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE.md's placement table
# sorts every directory by AUDIENCE -- documentation/ is "someone using
# Precedent on their own project", which is exactly who a vendored tree is
# for, and philosophy/ is not in that table at all. A consumer was cloning,
# scanning and scrubbing a case for adopting a thing they had adopted.
#
# No link goes dead: doc_lint.py skips the link check inside a mirrored tree
# outright (see check_broken_links), so the references into philosophy/ from
# the vendored README.md, METHOD.md and MAP.md report nothing in a consumer.
# The two checks that read philosophy/ (verify_harness.py) already report
# not-applicable when the directory is absent rather than passing blind.
#
# Five more joined 2026-09-17, checked against spec/DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE.md's
# own audience table (contributor/session-building-Precedent = cut,
# adopter/session-using-Precedent = keep) -- but the table alone is not what
# decided any of these; each was verified against its ACTUAL current
# content first, because the table's classification of one candidate
# (gotchas/, considered and rejected -- see below) turned out to be wrong on
# a real consumer and nearly cost 52 lines of live content:
#
#   spec/, todo/, decisions/, deck/ -- BestPractice's own build plans,
#   backlog and dated design decisions about the ENGINE, plus pitch-deck
#   tooling. Every citation into these four from a vendored (resident or
#   universal) practice file is a full external github.com URL, not a local
#   relative link -- the same pattern already accepted for philosophy/ -- so
#   a consumer session can always follow the citation over the network; it
#   never depends on a local copy under process/upstream/.
#
#   record/ -- the closer call of the five, flagged rather than asserted.
#   It is NOT what spec/DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE.md's still-unexecuted migration
#   proposal describes (that would move BestPractice's own phase briefs
#   here; none of that has landed). What actually lives in record/ today is
#   record/GOTCHAS.md and record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md -- the pre-migration,
#   monolithic predecessor to the current gotchas/*.md per-file split, kept
#   as the fuller story text and cited by #gN anchor from several resident
#   practices (session-text.md, very-deep-check.md, grep-before-search.md,
#   chief-of-staff.md, vendor-update-runbook.md). Those citations are also
#   full external URLs (same reasoning as above), and the LIVE, current
#   mechanism -- gotchas/*.md -- is not excluded (below). record/GOTCHAS.md
#   itself carries `audience: session` in its own frontmatter, which reads
#   against excluding it; this was weighed and record/ was excluded anyway
#   on the strength of the external-URL pattern and the gotchas/*.md split
#   already covering the live/operational half. Reopen this one specifically
#   if a session hits a case where the local copy was actually needed.
#
# CONSIDERED AND REJECTED: gotchas/. The original candidate list (drafted
# from a check-in session's own experience in a consumer repo) grouped it
# with todo/decisions/ by name-association, but its actual content is
# troubleshooting for RUNNING the vendored tooling (checkin.py itself,
# freshness-guard.sh, add_repo interactions, precedent_check.py), not
# planning for building it -- and it is reached the one way none of the
# above are: environment-gotchas.md, a RESIDENT universal practice, has its
# own Rule say "hit an unexplained failure, grep `gotchas/` before
# concluding it's new." A grep is a local filesystem operation; it finds
# nothing that is not actually vendored. Excluding gotchas/ would have left
# that instruction pointing at an empty directory in every consumer.
#
# ALSO CONSIDERED, kept IN: examples/ (now documentation/examples/, moved
# 2026-09-19 -- see below). Its README says plainly what it is for -- "here
# so that someone setting up their own [personal practice set] has
# something concrete to copy" -- which is an adopter activity (a consumer
# building their OWN practice set), not a contributor activity. Because it
# now lives under documentation/, which was never itself a NOT_VENDORED
# candidate, it is not even reachable by this comment's own top-level
# component-match test any more -- the move settles the audience question
# structurally instead of by a name-based judgment call.
#
# The move followed a relayed, unverified claim that a consumer repo was
# hand-deleting this directory after every Update Vendors pass; rather than
# exclude adopter-facing content on hearsay, it was relocated into
# documentation/ (the tree the repo's own audience table already assigns to
# "someone using Precedent on their own project") and a revisit was filed:
# todo/todo-2026-09-19-revisit-examples-vendoring.md. The staleness worry
# behind the same claim is separately covered by
# tools/verify_harness.py's check_example_set, which parses and resolves
# this example against the CURRENT format on every deep check and fails if
# it drifts -- so nothing new was built for that half of the concern.
#
# ALSO CONSIDERED, but out of THIS mechanism's scope: top-level .claude/ and
# .github/ (BestPractice's own dev/CI config, distinct from
# templates/harness/claude-code/ and templates/github-actions/, the actual
# instantiation sources -- confirmed absent from
# precedent_vendor_engine.py's CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES and unreferenced
# anywhere as process/upstream/.claude or process/upstream/.github) and
# local/ (BestPractice's own repo-local practice layer -- vendoring a
# repo-local layer into another repo is a category error by definition; no
# reference to "upstream/local" or "upstream.local" found anywhere in this
# repo's own tooling). Both read as clear NOT_VENDORED candidates on the
# same audience test, but adding them is deferred rather than folded in
# here silently -- flag for confirmation before extending NOT_VENDORED to
# non-spec-lifecycle top-level directories.
NOT_VENDORED = frozenset({'evals', 'philosophy', 'spec', 'todo', 'decisions',
                          'deck', 'record'})

# Root-only exclusions -- matched by exact top-level path, NEVER as a path
# component the way NOT_VENDORED is. `_files()`'s component match is right
# for a subject-matter directory (the same "gotchas" can only ever mean
# BestPractice's own gotchas/ at the top level) but wrong here: component
# matching on 'AGENTS.md'/'CLAUDE.md' would ALSO catch
# templates/harness/claude-code/CLAUDE.md and
# templates/document-project/AGENTS.md -- real TEMPLATE SOURCES a consumer
# instantiates from (INSTALL.md sec.2), not copies of this repo's own root
# files. Confirmed both exist and must stay vendored before adding this.
#
# Why exclude the root files at all, added 2026-09-17: AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
# are the one class of vendored file a harness auto-loads BY FILENAME as
# live instructions for whatever directory a session is working in --
# every other vendored file is read only when something goes looking for
# it. This repo's own root AGENTS.md has an explicit internal divider
# ("The rest of this file (below) is BestPractice's own pre-fork
# orientation") separating a generic loader section from content that is
# BestPractice talking about itself ("Default branch is main... this repo
# is public and is the shared upstream", "Most changes arrive as check-in
# PRs from dependent repos") -- and the whole file, tail included, was
# vendored as an ordinary byte-for-byte mirror. On 2026-09-17 that tail
# bled into a real consumer session as if it were live instructions about
# THAT repo's own workflow.
#
# Truncating just the tail at that divider was the first design tried and
# was rejected: _diff() and everything built on it (record()'s
# byte-identical verification, push()'s mirror-BACK guard, _carry_check())
# assume the vendored tree is either byte-identical to source or fully
# absent -- nothing in this tool has a third state of "present but

# THE COPY CARRIES WHAT A CONSUMER USES, NAMED (2026-09-30). Everything
# outside NOT_VENDORED used to go, so a consumer's process/upstream/ held
# 543 files: this repo's test suite (verify_harness.py, 2.6 MB), its own
# environment-trap notes (gotchas/), its repo-local practices (local/), the
# chat bridge, its own .claude/ and .github/ config, its MAP, index and
# to-do stub, and a second copy of the engine the repo already vendors
# into its own tools/. Morgan, 2026-09-30, asking what is normal: an
# allowlist, the way a package names the files it publishes -- "Consumers
# just want to use it not see our todo lists etc." ... "let's do. Act!".
#
# THE RULESET, and every file is decided by it (Morgan, 2026-09-30: "make
# sure that *every new file* is evaluated to see if it should be vendored
# in or not, and you should determine the ruleset"). The test:
#
#   SHIPS: what a consumer runs, instantiates, or its people read to adopt
#          and use Precedent -- the catalogue, templates, adopter guides,
#          the engine, and the settings files the engine reads from a
#          universal source's directory.
#   STAYS: how this repo is built -- its plans, open items, decisions,
#          reasoning, tests, run records, environment traps, repo-local
#          rules, its own settings and CI, its own sessions' instructions
#          and index, and separate tools it also builds.
#
# A document that is ours but that a consumer's reader needs is linked on
# GitHub from a shipped one, never shipped itself.
#
# First match wins; a path ending in '/' is a folder and everything in it.
# There is no catch-all: a path no rule covers is UNDECIDED, is left out of
# the copy, and fails precedent_check.py's `vendoring-decided` check in
# this repo until somebody adds the rule that decides it.
# `python3 tools/checkin.py rules` prints the decision for each file added

    spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md's "The default-branch gotcha" has
    said, since 2026-09-06, in as many words: *"Do the vendor as a one-off
    manual mirror ... not `checkin.py update`."* Until now nothing enforced
    it. The document mandated a procedure and the tool cheerfully did the
    thing the document forbade -- exactly the advisory-only state
    checkable-gets-checked exists to end, and the reason a session on
    2026-09-07 had to reason its way to the manual mirror from a paragraph
    instead of being stopped by a guard.

    THE CONDITION IS THE HOLD'S OWN CONDITION, so this retires itself. The
    hold applies "while a non-default branch is pinned"; this fires exactly
    when the manifest's `upstream.branch` differs from the clone's default.
    When precedent-beta-v01 merges to main and each consumer's manifest is
    repointed, pinned == default and the guard stops firing on its own --
    nobody has to remember to delete it, which is how a temporary guard
    usually outlives its reason.

    WHAT IT CANNOT REACH, and this is the important limit: a consumer still
    carrying a PRE-FIX vendored copy of this file. That copy has no guard,
    resolves the remote's default branch unconditionally, and would mirror
    `main` over a beta-vendored tree -- a silent wholesale revert. A guard
    shipped inside the tree it guards is missing from precisely the copies
    that need it, the same shape as the freshness-guard incident in
    AGENTS.md's gotchas. Such a consumer is only covered after one manual
    mirror brings this file in; the manual mirror is therefore still the
    entry point, not an alternative to it.

    An unknown default branch REFUSES rather than proceeding. The asymmetry
    is the hold's own, recorded by Morgan 2026-09-06: guessing wrong here
    costs a silent overwrite of a repo's practices, and refusing wrongly
    costs one manual mirror.

    THE OVERRIDE HAS TWO SPELLINGS, and the CLI one is the one to reach for
    first. `--allow-pinned` and `PRECEDENT_ALLOW_PINNED_UPDATE=1` do the
    same thing; the flag exists because the env var alone doesn't. Reproduced
    2026-09-17 from a real pinned-branch consumer: Claude Code Web's own
    permission classifier refused the env-var form outright, before
    checkin.py ever ran -- the name matches the shape it looks for ("ALLOW"
    overriding a hold) closely enough to read as a safety-bypass flag to the
    harness, not just to this tool. Every pinned-branch consumer running
    under it hit that same refusal on every Update Vendors pass. The env var
    still works for scripts and other harnesses that don't classify it that
    way; the flag is what a session running under a classifier like that
    should type instead.

    The failure this kills (2026-08-19, real): the vendored tree carried
    other threads' committed additions; a sync session hand-merged upstream's
    copy over them, push mirrored the lossy result, and record's
    tree-identical verification then STAMPED the loss as the new truth --
    detection was luck (the erased thread's session happened to be open).
    The carry-all-pending rule (INSTALL sec.4 step 1) states the obligation;
    this check enforces it at the chokepoint every cycle must pass through.

    Mechanism: every line ADDED in the dependent repo's committed default-
    branch vendored tree relative to the recorded base must be present in
    the landed upstream tree (same file, or anywhere in the tree to tolerate
    moves). A deliberate removal needs --accept-loss, which prints exactly
    what is being let go.

    THE BASE COMMIT MUST BE PRESENT FIRST, and that precondition is the
    whole difference between this check and a random-number generator. Read
    `_git_rc`'s docstring for why: without it, a clone that simply does not
    contain the recorded base reports EVERY line of the vendored tree as
    lost. Measured 2026-09-08 on a real consumer repo -- 69 "LOST" lines,
    all false, disprovable only by extracting both trees and diffing them by
    hand. That manual verification is the half a session skips, and the
    tempting shortcut is `--accept-loss`, which would accept a loss nobody
    measured -- turning the guard against silent data loss into its cause.

    UPSTREAM'S OWN DELETIONS ARE NEVER A LOSS, and two things make sure of
    it (2026-09-26, a real consumer: 301 "LOST" lines, every one a line
    BestPractice had deleted itself). The committed tree is read from the
    dependent's base branch, and under the branch tiers that branch takes
    work by Promote, later -- so it routinely holds an OLDER sync than the
    manifest names, and a hand-written `upstream.commit` widens the gap.
    Diffing it against the manifest's commit alone made every line upstream
    changed in between look local, and every one upstream deleted look lost.
    So: (1) a line is pending only if it is absent from the upstream tree at
    EVERY commit the committed tree could have come from -- the working
    manifest's commit and the committed manifest's own `synced_from` and
    `commit`, read off the same ref; and (2) a line still missing after that
    which an upstream commit between one of those and the landed HEAD
    deleted is reported as upstream's deletion and not counted. A line
    upstream never wrote still fails the check, exactly as before.

    (3) A LINE ANY EARLIER UPSTREAM VERSION OF THE FILE CARRIED IS
    UPSTREAM'S TOO (2026-09-30, a real consumer: 75 vendored files
    byte-identical to upstream versions OLDER than every stamp, because
    earlier syncs never refreshed them). No stamp reaches back to those
    versions, so (1) and (2) cannot see them; the file's own history can.
    Recording with --accept-loss did not end it either: the next run reads
    the base branch again, which does not hold the sync yet.

    THE LANDED SIDE IS READ FROM `landed_root`, the committed tree record()
    extracted at `tip`, never from the clone's working tree -- for the same
    reason record()'s tree comparison is (see _landed_commit). With neither
    given it falls back to the clone's working tree and HEAD, which only a
    direct caller that has no landed commit to name should rely on.
