"""precedent_materialize.py — bridges precedent_resolve.py's multi-source
resolution to the single-tree CONTENT tools (build_views.py,
precedent_paths.py, precedent_gate.py, precedent_check.py), none of which
understand more than one local practices/ directory.

spec/PHASE5_BRIEF.md named this gap explicitly: "precedent_resolve.py is
the ONLY multi-source-aware tool in this codebase... none of them accept
multiple source directories the way precedent_resolve.py does," and named
"materialize a merged tree" as the fastest of two shapes worth trying —
"a short script that calls precedent_resolve.py's own resolve() and writes
each winning practice's file into one local practices/-shaped directory,
then points build_views.py/precedent_paths.py/precedent_gate.py/
precedent_check.py at that directory unchanged."

THIS TOOL WRITES WHAT A SOURCE PUBLISHES, NOT THE ENGINE: the resolved
practices/ tree, each source's own tools/checks/ (a checked_by claim has
nothing behind it if only practices/ is copied — engine-plus-host-shims: the
engine travels with what it enforces), since 2026-09-26 every file a resolved
practice declares in its `ships:` field (see "Shipped files" below), and
since 2026-09-12 each source's
declared HARNESS ADAPTERS — the `bootstrap/*.sh` scripts its own practices
tell every consuming repo to wire into `.claude/hooks/`, which until then
travelled by hand-copy and so went silently stale (see the "Harness adapters"
section below for the two measured incidents and for what deliberately does
NOT travel). It does NOT vendor the engine scripts themselves
(build_views.py, precedent_paths.py, etc.) — that half is
already a solved, existing concern (INSTALL.md's vendoring model, or
cloning/copying this repo's tools/ into a consumer repo), unrelated to the
content-merging gap this tool closes.

THE HONEST COST, named rather than hidden (generated-artifact-provenance):
the materialized tree is a DERIVED ARTIFACT that needs regenerating on
every source update. A MANIFEST.json is written alongside it recording
what produced it and when, so drift is visible rather than silent — this
tool never claims the output is anything but a snapshot.

A filename collision between two sources' tools/checks/ scripts (or
tests/) is refused rather than silently overwritten — pick one, or rename
one of them; the resolver's own "two same-level practices cannot both
claim one slug" refusal is the same discipline applied here.

Usage:
  precedent_materialize.py --out DIR [--repo REPO] [--user-config PATH]
Exit: 0 on a clean materialization, 1 on a resolve conflict, an over-budget
resident set, a checks/ filename collision, a harness adapter declaration
that is malformed or collides on its destination, or a `ships:` declaration
(or a `declined_ships` entry in this repo's precedent.json) that is malformed
or collides on its destination.

    is not a separate tree materialize() can safely delete-and-rewrite: it
    is someone's hand-authored content, with no other copy anywhere.
    precedent_resolve.py's load_config now REQUIRES a repo-local source's
    path to be exactly "local" (2026-09-04), which rules out the most
    common way this used to happen -- a repo-local source declared at the
    bare root, colliding with a materialize run pointed at that same root
    -- before it ever reaches this function. This guard stays, unaffected,
    as the backstop for every OTHER level: a repo may legitimately declare
    universal or team at `path: "."` (this repo's own self-hosted
    precedent.json does exactly that), and load_config has no reason to
    forbid that on its own -- only a materialize() run whose --out happens
    to equal that same path makes it unsafe, which is a fact about the
    materialize INVOCATION, not the source declaration, and so has to be
    caught here rather than at resolve time.

    Two real, reproduced bugs came from allowing this combination through
    to materialize() anyway (2026-09-03 deep-check audit): (1) the moment a
    higher-precedence source shadows a slug this source also holds, ITS
    file is deleted and the winner's content is written over it, with no
    trace left that anything different was ever there -- the earlier
    "read every resolved practice into memory before deleting" fix only
    protects the file of the practice that WINS, not one that loses right
    where it lives; (2) once materialize() has run once, its own output
    (a check script or practice file belonging to a DIFFERENT source)
    sits physically inside this source's declared tree, so the NEXT run's
    resolve()/`_plan_checks` reads it back as if this source had authored
    it -- corrupting the resolved set itself, not just materialize()'s
    output, and not something a clean run today rules out for the run
    after it. Both are structural to source == destination, not fixable
    by reading harder before deleting -- refused unconditionally, whether
    or not today's resolved set happens to collide."""

# Link rewriting
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A practice file's relative links are written relative to ITS OWN
# directory in ITS OWN repository. Copied verbatim into a consuming repo's
# practices/, they point at nothing: `../tools/very_deep_check.py` and
# `../spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md` are real paths in Precedent and absent
# from every repo that installs it. So every consuming repo was shipping
# ~60 practice files whose internal links 404 -- and the practice files are
# the product. precedent-shared-repo-maintenance' own light check had already had
# to exempt materialized practices/ from its broken-link scan to stay
# green, which is the workaround this replaces.
#
# Two cases, decided by where the target actually lands:
#
#   inside the consuming repo   -- a repo-local source, whose files are
#                                  right there. Recompute the relative path
#                                  from the new location. (This half is a
#                                  bug in the same family and the opposite
#                                  direction: a repo-local practice at
#                                  local/practices/x.md writing `../tools/`
#                                  means local/tools/, which is NOT what

    Returns the rewritten bytes. Any link this cannot place confidently is
    left untouched -- the output is a copy of somebody's content, and
    silently mangling it would be a worse failure than the dead link this
    fixes.

    `sibling_slugs` is every slug THIS materialize run is writing, and it
    has to be passed rather than discovered on disk: practices are written
    in slug order, so at the moment an early one is rewritten a later
    sibling it cites does not exist yet. Checking the filesystem alone made
    a sibling citation survive or get turned into a URL depending on
    alphabetical order, which is the kind of bug that looks like it works
    until somebody adds a practice.

    `planned_out` is every path this run will write, relative to out_dir,
    and it is the same argument for a wider case. A practice that cites
    its own check script -- `../tools/checks/check_x.py`, the single most
    common cross-reference a practice makes -- was asking the filesystem,
    and the answer was always no: materialize() empties tools/checks/
    before it writes practices/ and only fills it afterwards. So the link
    got "placed" as an absolute URL into the source repository, which for
    a shared or individual source is a PRIVATE repository, replacing a
    relative link that would have worked perfectly once the run finished.
    Observed in a real four-source consumer, 2026-09-06. Asking the plan
    instead of the disk also makes a dry run and a real run agree by
    construction, which is what drift() needs to be trustworthy.

    `may_name_source_repo` is false for an INDIVIDUAL source, and that is a
    privacy boundary rather than a preference. precedent_resolve.load_config
    refuses an individual source declared in a shared repo's tracked config
    by name: a person's own set is named only in their user-level config, so
    that its existence and location cannot leak to everyone who can read the
    repo. Minting `https://github.com/<owner>/<private repo>/blob/...` into
    a tracked practices/ tree hands over exactly what that refusal protects,
    and a consuming repo can be public -- the project's own prior notes repository is. Caught
    2026-09-06 by a consuming repo's own private-repo-scrub check, on a link
    this rewriter had just created. The link is left as it was written
    instead: a relative link that does not resolve is a smaller failure than
    a disclosure that cannot be taken back.

    `forwards` ({slug: live slug}, from precedent_resolve.forwarding_map)
    and `forward_files` ({resolved source path: live slug}) repoint a link
    to a renamed or deduplicated practice at the practice it forwards to.
    A consumer materializes only what is in force, so the stub such a link
    names is never written there: renaming go-merge to go-update on
    2026-09-26 left every `go-merge.md` citation in the private sets dead in
    every consumer. Only a live slug this run writes is used, so the new
    link is a sibling by construction."""

    silently win. Returns a write plan (rel_label, filename, source_name,
    bytes) and does not touch the filesystem at all -- see materialize()
    for why reading has to fully finish before anything is deleted.

    `res` is the resolution this materialize is writing. When given, a
    check script no resolved practice CLAIMS via `checked_by` is left
    behind rather than copied: a script whose practice is retired, or
    lost a slug to a higher-precedence source, has nothing left to
    enforce here. Found on the first real run against
    precedent-team-repo-maintenance, whose `deep-check` practice is retired --
    its `check_deep_check.py` was still copied into the consuming repo,
    where it registered under its own filename (no practice to name it),
    reported "not in force", and counted as an unexplained file against
    the consuming repo's own materialized-tree audit.

    Deliberately narrower than 'every file in tools/checks/': a source's
    own tools/checks/tests/run_all.sh (found colliding on the very first
    real run of this tool, both private sets carry one) is a per-repo test
    DRIVER, not a per-check test a `checked_by` claim could ever name --
    merging it would be a false collision over a file nothing actually
    needs merged. It is not REPORTED as a skip, though, because it is
    not dropped -- it is REPLACED by the generated driver below. A routine
    line saying a source's copy "was not vendored", printed on every sync
    for every source that ships one, forever, stated the true half and
    invited a false second half: "so this repo has no driver." Two written
    records ended up contradicting each other on that plain fact, and
    settling it took a cross-repo investigation against this file. The
    line also named no action anyone could take, since the skip is correct
    and permanent. Provenance is recorded where a reader can consult it
    instead -- the generated file's own `GENERATED FILE -- do not
    hand-edit` header, and its `(generated)` entry in MANIFEST.json -- so
    silence about the driver now correctly means nothing was dropped, and
    the "not a per-check file, not vendored" line keeps its honest
    meaning: those files really were dropped, and really are gone.

    What IS reported about the driver is actionable, and goes silent once
    acted on: a source whose own run_all.sh does not DECLARE itself local
    -- by carrying LOCAL_DRIVER_MARKER somewhere in the file -- gets a
    stderr warning naming that source and the line to add. Here is the
    right home for that check because this function reads every source's
    driver on every sync, so one place covers every source of every
    consumer, present and future; a per-source check script would reach
    only its own set. It warns rather than raising: a MaterializeError
    here would break every consumer's sync the moment the engine was
    upgraded, over a defect in a comment.

    The driver is GENERATED instead, at the end of this function. Skipping
    the sources' copies is right; leaving the consumer without one was not.
    The `deep-check` practice requires tools/checks/tests/run_all.sh to
    exist -- so before 2026-09-06 that practice was unsatisfiable in every
    consuming repo, and its far more useful half (does each check_*.py have
    a test? is any test left behind after its check was deleted?) never ran
    at all, because the check returns early on the missing file. Supplying
    it by hand does not work either: tools/checks/ is this function's own
    output, wiped on every sync, and routing the file through a repo-local
    source hits this same filename rule.

    Generating rather than copying is not a workaround, it is the more
    honest description. The driver carries no source-specific content --
    it globs test_*.sh in its own directory, so it must run whatever THIS
    repo materialized, which is a property of the output, not of any one
    source. That is also why the collision disappears: a generated file is
    claimed by nobody, so there is no winner to pick."""

# Harness adapters
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# practice: engine-plus-host-shims -- the engine travels with what it
# enforces, and a harness adapter is the host shim half of exactly that.
# practice: registry-source-of-truth -- the declaration lives in the ONE
# machine-readable registry a source already has, and drift() is the audit
# that detects the disagreement.
# practice: checkable-gets-checked -- "the settings wiring does not travel"
# is a refusal below, not a paragraph anyone has to remember.
#
# A practice source publishes three kinds of thing, and until 2026-09-12 only
# two of them travelled mechanically: the engine, by
# precedent_vendor_engine.py with a sha256 per file, so a hand-edit is refused
# as drift; and practices plus their checks, by this tool. The third is the
# HARNESS ADAPTERS a source's own practices tell every consuming repo to
# install -- `bootstrap/freshness-guard.sh` copied into
# `.claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh`, and the same for the commit-identity and
# session-start hooks. Those travelled by somebody remembering, per each
# practice's own Install section. So a repo carrying a copy went silently
# behind the moment the source's script changed: nothing announced the change,
# and nothing could report which repos were stale.
#
# Twice in two days, measured rather than imagined. A consuming repo's check
# produced two findings against its freshness guard; both had already been
# fixed in the source set, so they were true statements about that repo's own
# stale copy and were briefed as open defects in the source, and a session
# spent its first hour disproving them. Separately, the same repo's
# `commit-identity.sh` sat about five kilobytes behind its source -- a hundred
# lines present canonically and absent there, no local adaptation, just old --
# with its own check passing, because every check it had was reading the stale
# copy.
#
# WHY THIS TOOL. The argument is the one already in this file's docstring, one
# step further out: a checked_by claim has nothing behind it if only
# practices/ is copied. An adapter is the same shape. `fresh-before-write`'s
# Rule IS an adapter -- "every project I work in gets both halves of
# bootstrap/freshness-guard.sh wired into its own .claude/settings.json" -- and
# a materialized practices/fresh-before-write.md sitting beside a months-old
# .claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh is exactly the failure that sentence already
# rejects for checks. This tool is also the only one that runs on every
# consumer's sync, already resolves the sources, and already writes the
# MANIFEST.json that makes a derived file a declared artifact rather than an
# untracked hand-copy that a consumer's own orphan detection reads as
# hand-dropped. A sibling tool would have had to duplicate all three.
#
# WHAT DOES NOT TRAVEL, AND IS REFUSED RATHER THAN DOCUMENTED: the settings
# wiring. A source's `bootstrap/*.snippet.json` carries `main` as the base
# branch and each consuming repo substitutes its own, so the install step
# stays "copy the script; merge the snippet by hand, replacing the base
# branch". Copying a consumer's `.claude/settings.json` would silently repoint
# its base branch -- the one inference the freshness guard refuses to make for
# itself, since a wrong base branch is how a guard reports everything fine
# about a checkout cut from a stale base. A declared destination whose
# basename is settings.json or settings.local.json is refused below, because a
# rule that only the prose enforces is a rule somebody eventually types past
# (checkable-gets-checked).
#
# HOW A SOURCE DECLARES THEM -- in its own precedent.json, which is the
# registry it already has (registry-source-of-truth: state lives in ONE
# machine-readable registry). A second bootstrap/ADAPTERS.json would be a
# second place to look and a second format to keep in step, for a list that is
# three lines long:
#
#   "adapters": [
#     {"from": "bootstrap/freshness-guard.sh",
#      "to":   ".claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh"}
#   ]
#
# A CONSUMER THAT EDITED ITS COPY is overwritten, deliberately, and told. The
# adaptation point for an adapter is the settings wiring, which does not
# travel; the script itself is a derived artifact like every other file this
# tool writes, and a consumer holding a private edit of it is the state this
# whole mechanism exists to end. What is NOT acceptable is doing that
# silently, so the first replacement of content this tree never recorded as
# materialized -- a hand-copy being adopted, or a local edit being reverted --
# prints a notice naming the file, while an ordinary update from a source that
# moved stays quiet. Afterwards the manifest hash makes a later hand-edit a
# drift() finding, which is the audit half the same change would otherwise
# still be owed.

# THE INCIDENT (2026-09-26). precedent-shared-writing's create-word-doc
# practice owns tools/create_word_doc.py: its Rule tells a session to run the
# script, and its shipped test copies it (`cp "$SET_ROOT/tools/
# create_word_doc.py" ...`). This tool shipped the practice and the test and
# never the script, so in a consumer without a hand-copy the consumer's deep
# check went red on a test it could neither fix nor satisfy. The practice's
# own Detail said consumers "copy it in by hand" -- the same arrangement the
# harness adapters above had until their two measured incidents, and the
# same outcome. Nothing declared the dependency, so nothing could deliver it,
# and nothing noticed when a practice moved between sets without it.
#
# SAME CONTRACT AS THE ADAPTERS, for the same reasons: read everything
# before writing anything; refuse a destination two sources both claim;
# write file by file, never by emptying a directory (tools/ holds the
# consumer's own scripts and the vendored engine); record each file in
# MANIFEST.json so drift() can compare it; replace a copy the manifest never
# recorded, loudly; report, never delete, a file no practice ships any more.
#
# ONE DIFFERENCE: a consumer may DECLINE one, in its own precedent.json,
# with a reason. An adapter is part of the machinery every consumer runs; a
# shipped file serves a practice's Rule, and a repository may have decided
# it does not want the half of that Rule the file serves -- create-word-doc
# itself allows every export to be a hand-built one-off. The reason is
# required and recorded in the manifest, so "declined" and "never
# delivered" stay distinguishable:

    practice as a reference to a file "this branch deleted" and asks for it to
    be repointed -- at something that cannot exist here. Found 2026-09-07:
    excluding a public consumer's private practices produced 26 such findings
    in one repo, six of them inside a vendored tree nobody can edit there. The
    practices were not renamed or deleted; they are published elsewhere and
    withheld here, which is a third state those checks had no way to see.

    `excluded_engine_dev` is a DIFFERENT third state, on a different axis:
    slugs resolved with `scope: engine-dev`, which this repo (whichever one
    this run is materializing INTO) is deliberately never given, regardless
    of that repo's visibility. Recorded separately from `withheld` rather
    than folded into it -- one is about who may see a practice, the other
    about who could ever act on it, and the two lists can overlap for
    unrelated reasons (name-both-sides-of-ledger: keep what is excluded and
    why distinguishable, not just the fact that something was)."""

# The read-only half. A check that mutates what it is checking is worse

#
# 2026-09-06, found against a real four-source consumer install. Its
# AGENTS.md tells every session to run `precedent_sync_views.py --check` at
# session start, and --check guarded only the AGENTS.md write -- materialize()
# ran unconditionally underneath it, so every "check" silently rewrote
# practices/, tools/checks/ and MANIFEST.json in the working tree. Two
# consequences, both observed, not reasoned about:
#
#   * A consuming repo's own light check correctly failed on a materialized
#     check script that had drifted from its source. Running --check made
#     the failure disappear -- not by fixing the drift, by overwriting the
#     drifted file from the live source. The next run reported clean.
#   * With one source temporarily unreachable -- the ordinary state of a
#     fresh session before `add_repo` has run, which both consuming repos'
#     own instructions describe -- a --check run DELETED 57 tracked files:
#     every practice and check script that source contributed. It printed
#     a check verdict while doing it.
#
# So --check now plans everything (same out_dir, so link rewriting resolves
# identically) and compares against disk instead of writing.
