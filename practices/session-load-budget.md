## Rule
**Everything a session loads before it does any work carries a declared
ceiling, and every ceiling lives in one registry** —
[tools/session_load_budgets.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/session_load_budgets.json).
That is the instructions file, anything it includes, the generated resident
block, and the session-start file the private sources write. A surface that
is loaded and not in the registry is the finding; so is one over its ceiling.

**Measure every repo in force, not the one you are rooted in.** A session
loads its own instructions file *and* whatever each attached team,
individual and repo-local source contributes, and the cost is the sum. A
per-repo cap that is green in each repo separately says nothing about what
any session actually pays.

**A cap on one part is not a cap on the whole, and reading it as one is the
failure this exists to prevent.** The resident block's 2,000-token cap
governs the resident block. It governed about 4% of this repository's own
session load while the rest went unmeasured for weeks.

**Then reduce — and reduce by moving, never by deleting.** The question for
each part is **"would a session hit this today"**, never "how big is it". What
still bites stays, whatever it costs; what no longer bites moves to a linked
archive **in full**, because the payload of a gotcha is the story of what
failed ([environment-gotchas](environment-gotchas.md)). A trimming pass that
chases the total deletes the entries that are working, and leaves a live
section of unexplained rules behind.

**The moves, in order, and the report they owe are
[reduction-pass](reduction-pass.md)'s** — six of them, cheapest and
provably lossless first, and it is what the person is asking for when they
say **"Reduction pass"**. Not repeated here: one menu, in the practice that
performs it.

**A ceiling is a watermark, not an endorsement.** It is set at what the
surface measured when it was last reviewed, so it ratchets down and never
drifts up unnoticed. **Only the person raises one**: show them the number
before and after, ask, and record their own words for that raise in the
registry's `approved_budgets`. That covers every budget *in force*, so a
formula, fallback or newly summed source that makes the number bigger is a
raise even when no field changed. Never raise one to make a red check green,
and say any change to a budget in that reply's Boildown.

**A cap warns on the way into pre-staging and refuses on the way into
staging.** Over a cap,
[tools/build_views.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/build_views.py)
still writes the block and prints a warning, and the pre-staging check
reports the cap checks as warnings, so a branch can land. **Tell the person
it must be brought under before it can go to staging:** the full check at
the Debut refuses it (`loader-within-caps`, `session-load-budget`,
`session-file-allowances-fit`), exactly as before. Morgan, 2026-09-30
(strength: decided): *"remove that limit for pre-staging and instead just
have it give the session user a warning, including telling the user that it
needs to be fixed before it can get onto staging; but no change for the
rules for staging."* A raised budget still needs the person's own words, on
every tier.

**When the resident cap refuses a new practice, the person picks what comes
out.** The refusal says to demote or retire a resident practice — that is a
session's cue to **ask**, not to choose. List the resident practices with what each costs and what
dropping it would let through, recommend one, and wait for an answer.
Demoting a practice to `on-demand` to make room changes which rules fire in
every session afterwards, decided by the session that wanted the room.

## Detail
**What counts as an always-loaded surface.** Anything in a session's context
before its first turn: `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (and whichever of the two
the harness reads), the generated resident block and occasion index inside
them, `.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md`, and each attached source's own
instructions file. Not: a practice's Rule pulled on occasion, a spec read
because somebody asked, or anything reached through a link. The line is
whether a session pays for it having decided nothing.

**Two ceilings that are not the same ceiling.** `resident_block_tokens` is a
hard build cap — [tools/build_views.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/build_views.py) refuses to
generate a resident block over it, so the trade is forced at the moment
somebody promotes a practice. A surface `ceiling` is a review trigger: it
fails the check, and what it asks for is a reduction pass, not a deletion.
**The occasion index is capped where it grows** (Morgan, 2026-09-29,
strength: decided). Each practice source declares its own share of every
consumer's index as `occasion_share_tokens` in its `precedent-source.json`,
and `build_views.py` refuses to build that source over it. A repository
with no `occasion_index_tokens` of its own is capped at the sum of its
declared sources' shares plus `repo_local_occasion_tokens` for its own
`local/` practices, so a set that grows is refused in the set, not in every
repository that uses it.
`section_review_tokens` is neither — it is the size at which
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s SESSION LOAD
section flags one `##` section as worth splitting.

**Where the reduction usually is.** In practice it is one section, not the
whole file: a gotchas section that has accumulated settled entries, an index
that has grown a row per file rather than a row per question, a preamble
that has become a changelog. Read the per-section table SESSION LOAD prints
and work the largest one; the total is an outcome, never the target.

**Three moves, in the order worth trying.** **Delete** only what is duplicated
somewhere the session already reads — and check that it really is, word for
word, rather than assuming. **That first move is mechanical now**: the check
reports text a change adds that already sits in a practice file, and the deep
read reports every such run in the whole surface. Neither decides — repetition
sharp enough to be worth saying twice is a real answer — but nothing has to be
found by reading everything any more. **Retire** what can no longer happen, to a linked
record with the verdict that retired it. **Split** what is still live and still
long: the section keeps one line per item and the text moves out whole, which
is [environment-gotchas](environment-gotchas.md)'s index-plus-record shape and
the only one of the three that scales. A split is the largest reduction
available and the easiest to do dishonestly, so the rule is the same every
time: **nothing is shortened on its way out**, and whatever checked the text
where it was has to follow it.

**This does not license trimming a source you do not own.** A team or
individual source over its ceiling is a finding to report to whoever owns it
([cross-source-rollout](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/cross-source-rollout.md)), not an edit to make from
here.

**Approvals, targets and the hard ceiling (2026-09-30).**
`approved_budgets` in the registry holds, per budget, the highest value the
person approved: `max`, `approved_by` (their name, the date and their quoted
words) and `strength`. `baseline` marks the values in force when the list
began, recorded rather than freshly approved.
`precedent_check.py --only budget-within-approval` reads each budget through
`build_views.effective_budgets()`, the same functions that enforce it, and
fails on any above its approval or with none. It needs no base commit, so it
answers the same at commit, push, merge, CI and Promote, whoever merged
what. A surface's `target` is where it is meant to live: over it, the
session-start file opens with a warning, once per session, and the reply
gate asks for one line in The Boildown in every reply. Its `hard_ceiling`
is enforced where growth is made, and only there: nothing refuses a commit
in the repo that loads the file, because no commit there can make a file
built from other repos smaller (a commit block for that was built
2026-09-30 and retired the same day, never switched on; Morgan: "Since it's
never used then let's retire it completely. Approved. Act."; strength:
decided). `session-file-allowances-fit` requires each
carried source's `occasion_share_tokens` plus its `resident_block_tokens`,
plus the entry's `fixed_allowance`, to add up to at most the hard ceiling,
and each source's own build refuses to grow past those numbers.

## Why
Nothing is wrong at any single commit. Every line in an always-loaded file
was right to add on the day it was added, and it only goes wrong in
aggregate, months later — which is exactly the failure a per-commit gate
cannot see, and exactly the failure a declared ceiling can.

The cost is real and it is paid on every turn of every session. It is also
paid *first*, before the work, so it comes out of the same budget the work
needs — a repository that spends twenty thousand tokens explaining itself has
that much less room for the thing it was opened to do.

The reason this needs a rule rather than a habit is that the measurement and
the remedy pull in opposite directions. Measuring rewards deletion; the
content being measured is the accumulated cost of every trap this project has
already paid for once. **A rule that only said "measure" would reliably make
the repository worse.** So the ceiling and the "would a session hit this
today" test ship together, and the archive-in-full clause is the part that
does the work.

## Story
**Morgan asked for it on 2026-09-11**, as a question about
[very-deep-check](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/very-deep-check.md): does the very deep check review token
use across the repo *and the repos it calls*, check the 2,000-token cap at
its various points, and then look for where usage can be reduced — and if
not, that should be a rule.

Half of it was already there and half was not. Pass 3 of the very deep check
carries "What every session loads, and what it costs", added 2026-09-08 after
the resident block's 2,000-token budget was found reporting green for weeks
while [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/AGENTS.md) around it passed 17,000 — the budget
governing 4% of the cost, with nothing measuring the rest. That pass moved 24
gotcha entries' full text to
[record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md) and took ≈4,900
tokens off every session, deleting nothing.

**What was missing was everything that makes it a rule rather than a
paragraph.** It ran only inside the very deep check — on request, rarely, by
a session that thought to ask. It measured only `repo_root`, so the attached
sources were never counted despite the very deep check's own scope sentence
saying every repo in force. And no surface had a declared ceiling, so
"reporting green" meant only that no single section had crossed a flag: the
file as a whole could not be over anything, because it was not under
anything.

Measured the day this was written, on this repository: `AGENTS.md` **19,687
tokens**, of which the gotchas section is 10,494, the occasion index 2,678 and
the resident block 894 — plus `.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md` at 2,887.
**22,624 tokens before the first turn**, with a cap declared over 894 of them.

**It fired on its own repository within the hour**, which is the part worth
keeping. The ceiling was set at 19,000 against a checkout 14 commits behind;
merging `precedent-beta-v01` brought a freshness-guard gotcha added upstream
the same day and put the file at 19,687, over its own ceiling. The rule's
first demand is a reduction pass, so that is what was run: every entry
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) flagged as claiming its
own trap settled was read against the tree, and each still bites — including
the new one, which says in its own words that the shape of the trap survives
the fix. So nothing was archived and the ceiling was raised once, to 20,000,
with that reasoning written into the registry entry. **A ceiling raised after
the review is the mechanism working; one raised instead of it is the failure
the clause is about**, and the difference is only ever visible in what the
`why` field says.


**The ask-before-demoting clause was added later the same day**, also by
Morgan, asking what happens when a new resident practice would break the
2,000-token cap: *"do we check to see if it kills the 2000 token limit before
we do that? If it does, it should ask what we want to remove."* The check
existed — [tools/build_views.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/build_views.py)
refuses to write an over-budget block and exits non-zero — and what was
missing was the second half: its failure message tells a session to demote or
retire something, and says nothing about whose call that is. The obvious
reading of a refusal is that the session clears its own path.

## Install
The registry is
[tools/session_load_budgets.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/session_load_budgets.json): one
entry per always-loaded surface, each carrying `ceiling`, the `measured` size
and the date it was `reviewed`, plus the `resident_block_tokens` cap
[tools/build_views.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/build_views.py) enforces at build time and
the `section_review_tokens` flag
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) prints against. Both
tools read the registry rather than carrying their own literal, so no cap is
spelled twice.

`python3 tools/precedent_check.py --only session-load-budget` runs the
mechanical half in any repo the engine is vendored into: it fails on a loaded
surface with no entry, and on one over its ceiling. An adopting repo with no
registry gets a named skip, not a pass.

**Keeping the registry is the opt-in, and carrying the practice file is not a
second condition.** That check binds wherever
[tools/session_load_budgets.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/session_load_budgets.json)
exists, whether or not the repo vendors
this practice's own text — a repo that wrote a ceiling down has asked for it
to be enforced. Before 2026-09-22 it also required the practice file, and a
repo that declared ceilings without it got a skip reading *"this check
belongs to a source this repo does not resolve"* — true of the practice, and
wrong about the registry sitting right there. Its AGENTS.md ran 476 tokens
over its own declared ceiling with every check green.

The sum across every repo in force — and the reduction pass itself — is
[very-deep-check](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/very-deep-check.md)'s SESSION LOAD section, which prints
this checkout and each attached source, section by section, **and reports any
file over the ceiling its own repo declared.** Those are two different
findings on purpose: a section flagged for review is a reading-cost question,
and a file over its ceiling is this rule being broken.
