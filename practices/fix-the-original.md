## Rule
**A file you are fixing may be a copy, and the copy is never the whole
job.** Before reporting any fix done, answer three questions out loud:

1. **Where did this file come from?** A template, a vendored tree, another
   repo that had it first.
2. **Who else has a copy?** Every other place the same file, or the same
   mistake, went.
3. **What should have caught it earlier, and why didn't it?** When one gate
   passed what a later one failed — local green but GitHub red, one
   checkout's gate green and another's red — **that difference is its own
   bug, and its fix ships with this one.**

**Fix the origin first, then the copies and the gate, and name all of them
in the reply.** An origin this session cannot reach is a `blocked-on` item
naming the repository — never a silent omission.

## Detail
**Before a fix, a different rule applies.** When the bug is upstream and this
repository only holds a copy, [upstream-bug-stops-here](upstream-bug-stops-here.md)
stops the local edit and hands the fix to the owning repository. The questions
here are for the fix that does get made: where it came from, who else has a
copy, and which gate missed it.

**The first two questions are one search, and the third is one comparison.**
That is deliberate: this is a lookup, not a meditation on root causes. A
session that cannot find an origin in one search says so and moves on. The
third asks what the gate that passed had, or lacked, that the gate that
failed did not — a machine with a module installed, a directory with the
other clones beside it.

**This is a different axis from the three practices that look like it**, and
the gap between them is where the failure lives:

| Practice | Asks | Blind to |
|---|---|---|
| [durable-fix](durable-fix.md) | *Where does the fix live?* | How many copies exist. A downstream repo's edited copy is a committed file, so it scores rung 1 and passes. |
| [generated-edit-goes-upstream](generated-edit-goes-upstream.md) | *Is this file generated?* | A file nothing regenerates. An instantiated copy is not a render, so this never fires on it. |
| [mistakes-become-rules](mistakes-become-rules.md) | *What rule prevents the next one?* | The artifact itself. A rule can be written while the template stays broken. |

**The case this exists for is the instantiated copy**: a file born from a
template or copied between repos, that nothing regenerates and no manifest
tracks. It is invisible to all three above by construction.

**"The same mistake" counts, not only the same file.** A wrong argument
copied into five hooks is one origin and five copies even where the five
files are otherwise unrelated.

**On the mechanical check, which was attempted and declined with a reason**
([checkable-gets-checked](checkable-gets-checked.md) requires the attempt,
not the outcome). Two designs were built and run against this tree on
2026-09-12:

- **Same-basename divergence across the repo and every attached source**
  reported **12 identical and 100 divergent** basenames. Nearly all of the
  100 are correct work — per-case test fixtures that are *supposed* to
  differ, and per-source `approvers.json` files whose whole purpose is to
  differ. A check that fires on a hundred correct files teaches the next
  session to ignore the gate.
- **Template-to-instantiation similarity**, narrowed to `templates/` against
  the rest of the tree, was far cleaner: **six pairs**, four identical and
  two divergent. But both divergences are legitimate and **each instance
  already documents why it differs from its template in its own header** —
  so the check would be red on the unplanted tree from the day it landed.

**The reason no check is wired is therefore specific: divergence is not the
signal.** A copy that legitimately differs and a copy that drifted are
identical to a differ, and nothing in the tree records which is which.
**The checkable version of this practice is a provenance stamp**, not a
similarity threshold — and that is a real design, not a shrug, filed in
[todo/TODO.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/TODO.md).
The one family that *does* carry provenance is already checked:
[tools/precedent_refresh_sources.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_refresh_sources.py)
compares each source's vendored engine against canonical, which is why
engine staleness reaches a person at session start and template drift does
not.

## Why
**The cost is paid in a different repository from the one that saves it**,
which is why no single session ever sees it. Fixing the copy in front of you
genuinely solves your problem; the recurrence lands on someone else, months
later, looking like a new bug because its surface details are new.

**The person watching is the only one who can see it**, and that is the
failure mode worth naming: the signal that this practice is missing is a
human having to say *"also change it in the template"* — repeatedly, across
unrelated threads, because each session in isolation was correct.

## Story
**Requested by Morgan, 2026-09-12, in those terms:** *"I often have to
remind you, make this change not just in this file, but in the original
template that led to it."* He described the general shape too — a fix
applied once, in one repo, while the cause stays free to fire again
elsewhere.

**This repository had already paid for it twice, and recorded both without
generalising either.** `commit-identity.sh` was found **one version behind
in all five** real private practice sets — uniform drift, which is what a
template fix that never went back to the template looks like from the
outside. One of those sets' `freshness-guard.sh` was about three thousand
bytes shorter than canonical, supporting two modes where the current file
supports three.

**What was built in response was a repair path, not a prevention.**
`precedent_refresh_sources.py --apply` restores a drifted hook, and the
session that wrote it recorded the asymmetry precisely: *"there was an
install path and no repair path."* Both are downstream of the copy already
having diverged. **Nothing asked, at the moment of the fix, where the file
came from** — and that moment is the only one at which the drift costs
nothing to prevent.

**The third question was added 2026-09-28, after the first two passed twice
in one session and the root was still missed.** A shared practice set's
check script did `import yaml` unconditionally and crashed on GitHub's bare
runner, turning a consuming repo's pull request into main red. The session
fixed the script at its origin, the set, which answered questions 1 and 2
correctly. It never asked why the local push check had passed the same tree:
the local machine had PyYAML, and BestPractice's consumer CI template, unlike
its practice-set template, never installed it. The same hour, the leak gate
passed a private repository's name into a public set, because it was run
from a worktree whose directory held none of the other clones; run from the
main clone, it flagged the name. Both times the bug that mattered was the
gap between a gate that passed and one that failed. Morgan asked *"can we
make that practice stronger"* and approved this wording with *"Go update on
the fixes and wording"* (strength: decided).

## Install
Two questions before any fix is reported, and one line in the reply.

- **Search for the origin.** `grep -rl "<a distinctive line from the file>"`
  across the repo and any attached sources, or check whether a `templates/`
  copy of the same basename exists.
- **Fix the origin first**, then the copies. Doing it in that order is what
  keeps the copies from being forgotten once the visible symptom is gone.
- **Name every file in the reply**, per
  [reply-links-files](reply-links-files.md). A fix that touched an origin
  and three copies is four entries, not one.
- **Where the origin is out of reach**, say so in those words and queue it
  per [todo-is-a-handoff](todo-is-a-handoff.md) with the repository named —
  the same `blocked-on` reasoning
  [cross-source-rollout](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/cross-source-rollout.md) already uses.
