## Rule
**The phrase is the clean trigger, not the only one** — "can you just say
that plainly" or "talk to me like I'm across the desk from you" ask for the
same thing and get it. When the person says **"Simple please"**, or plainly
asks for it, explain it the way you would say it out loud to them across a
desk. Short sentences. Everyday vocabulary. The concrete case before the
general principle. **No hedging, no caveat stack, no survey of positions you
are not taking.**

It governs that reply **and every reply after it in the conversation**, until
they say otherwise. It is a request about register, not about that one answer.

**Nothing about the substance changes.** Same conclusions, same numbers, same
recommendation, same "Files touched" list, same refusal to invent a figure
you do not have ([no-invented-specifics](no-invented-specifics.md)). If the
plain version says something different from what the careful version would
have said, the plain version is wrong.

## Detail
What actually changes, in order of how much it buys:

- **Lead with the concrete case.** Their example, their repository, their
  three teams — then the rule it illustrates. Not the definition first.
- **One idea per sentence**, and stop the sentence when the idea ends.
- **Everyday words** where a term of art was doing no work. Where the term
  is load-bearing, keep it and gloss it once in the same breath
  ([readers-vocabulary](readers-vocabulary.md) is the outward-facing
  version of the same instinct).
- **Cut the hedges.** *"It may be worth considering"* is *"do this"* wearing
  a coat. Say which you recommend.
- **Cut the survey.** Two options and a verdict beats four options and a
  shrug.

**Plain is not shorter, and it is not vaguer.** A plain explanation of
something complicated can run longer than the compressed one, because it
spends words on the example instead of on precision the reader cannot use.
The failure to avoid is a reply that reads easily and says less: dropping the
number, the name, the caveat that actually bites. **Drop the performance, not
the content.**

**It does not turn off the repository's own conventions.** The reply still
ends with its "Files touched" list ([reply-links-files](reply-links-files.md)),
still bolds its key phrases ([bold-key-phrases](bold-key-phrases.md)), still
discloses where a practice landed ([disclose-landing](disclose-landing.md)).
Those are about what a reply must contain; this is about how it sounds.

## Why
**Register mismatch is a tax paid on every single reply**, and it is
invisible: the answer is correct, the person reads it twice anyway, and
nobody files that as a defect. Asking for plainer language costs a paragraph
of setup each time, so in practice people stop asking and just re-read.

A named phrase is that paragraph, written once — the same argument
[three-things](three-things.md) makes for its own fixed shape. It also gives
the person a **switch they can flip mid-conversation**, which matters more
than it sounds: the register that suits a design argument is not the one that
suits an explanation of that argument to somebody who was not in it.

Placed at universal because it is an opinion about how anyone should be able
to talk to a session, with nothing in it specific to any project, team or
person — the same reasoning that put Booked (`Go update`), `Drop it` and `Three Things`
here.

## Story
**Coined by Morgan, 2026-09-08.** He had asked for an explanation of a
cross-repository design question to be redone "more simply", liked the
result, and asked for a way to get it on demand: *"what's a short phrase I
can use to get you to talk to me in this way? Maybe that should be a new
command and glossary word."*

The session proposed `Plain words` against two alternatives and he took it,
in the same message that authorized landing it. The name matters more than it
looks: the retired `merge-authorization-keyword` told every adopting
repository to go invent its own phrase, and a phrase nobody spells out is a
phrase every session guesses at. This one names itself.

The occasion that produced it is worth keeping too, because it is the
recurring one. The original reply was accurate and dense; the second attempt
said the same things with the example first and the hedges gone, and was
better by every measure except effort. **Nothing stopped the first reply from
being written that way except that nobody had asked.**

**Extended 2026-09-16, on Alex's design point**, that a plain request for
this register should count as much as the phrase itself — low-stakes here,
unlike the same conversation's changes to `go-update` and `weak-yes`: a wrong
read just gets corrected with "no, plainer" and costs nothing else.

**Renamed to `Simple words`, 2026-09-20, Morgan**: *"Let's rename 'Plain
words' to 'Simple words' just because I use the word simple, not plain."*
The slug, filename and every historical quote above keep the old wording —
only the trigger phrase, and every live reference to it, changed. This is
the same low-stakes shape as the 2026-09-16 extension: a session that hears
the old word still recognizes the intent and gets corrected once.

**Renamed again, to `Simple please`, 2026-09-26, Morgan**: *"I want to
rename 'Simple words' to 'Simple please'."* Strength: decided. Same shape as
the rename before it: only the trigger phrase and its live references moved,
and the slug, the file and the quotes above stay as they were. "Simple
words" still gets this reply, as any plain ask for the register does; it is
just no longer the phrase the vocabulary lists.

## Install
Nothing mechanical checks it, and the attempt was considered rather than
skipped ([checkable-gets-checked](checkable-gets-checked.md)): every
mechanical proxy for "plain" is a proxy for **short** — sentence length,
syllable counts, a banned-phrase list — and this practice says explicitly
that plain is not shorter. A check that fired on length would push replies
away from the examples that make them plain, so the honest state is
advisory, and this paragraph is the reason.

What reaches a session is the generated occasion index entry, so an adopter
installs nothing.
