applies_to_why: "The occasion is EXPORTING a tool across a repo boundary, which happens in the vendored tree and the host shims -- not in tools/, where the engine is merely authored. A first draft of this pass used tools/** and surfaced the practice on 10 of 20 eval cases against 3 it applies to; re-reading the occasion is what narrowed it, not the cost figure, though the cost figure is what prompted the re-read. Decided: phase 4 routing pass."

## Rule
A practice that ships tooling (a renderer, a lint, a sync gate) crosses the
repo boundary as **code plus config**, split on one line: **domain-neutral
mechanism lives in the vendored upstream tree and is the single
implementation; everything host-specific — registries, vocabulary, index
names, scan scopes — lives in a thin shim in the host repo** that loads the
vendored module, sets its configuration attributes, and delegates. The
practice text carries the behavior contract (the numbered spec of what the
tool delivers), which is also what lets a host on a different stack
reimplement deliberately rather than accidentally.

## Detail
**The rule of thumb for what goes where:** if a change would be wanted by
every repo using the tool, it is engine — edit the vendored file, and it
ships upstream at the next check-in; if only this repo would want it, it is
config — edit the shim. A new check, a new interaction, a bug fix: engine.
A new document registered, a new stopword, a different default branch:
shim.

**Work done on the engine in a consumer goes back upstream by a
three-way merge**, with the consumer's last-synced copy as the base
([vendor-update-runbook](vendor-update-runbook.md)). The engine is the
file both sides edit, so it is the one a plain copy damages.

## Why
**Why not a fork.** A host that copies the tool and edits its copy is
running two implementations synced by hand. The vendoring audit's drift
hashes will nag, but every improvement is edited twice, and the copies
diverge the first time someone forgets. (Origin: the first dependent repo
maintained renderer, lint, and sync-gate forks in lockstep through one day
of heavy feature work — every change patched twice — then collapsed all
three to shims; behavior was verified identical before and after, the
renderer's output byte-for-byte, and ≈1,400 lines of duplicate
implementation disappeared. The collapse also surfaced a latent bug: the
exported sync-gate copy referenced a config name no one had ever defined,
because nothing had ever executed it.)

**Why not spec-only.** A tool's value is its accumulated behavioral detail
— the numeric sort keys that survive currency suffixes, the filter that
survives a column move, the false-positive guards on a check. A dependent
repo reimplementing from prose gets a different-in-a-hundred-ways tool and
re-learns every lesson. Spec and code are not competitors: the spec is the
contract, the vendored code is the reference implementation, and a repo
that can run it should never be writing its own.

## Story
**One day of paying for the same change three times.** The first dependent
repo maintained forks of the renderer, the lint and the sync gate in
lockstep through a day of heavy feature work -- every change patched into
each copy by hand. All three were then collapsed to thin shims over a single
vendored implementation, with behavior verified identical before and after,
the renderer's output byte-for-byte, and roughly 1,400 lines of duplicate
implementation removed.

**The collapse surfaced a latent bug that is the better argument.** The
exported copy of the sync gate referenced a configuration name nobody had
ever defined -- it had never been caught because that copy had never
executed. A fork does not merely cost double edits; it silently accumulates
code that is wrong in ways nothing can discover, and the stale copy is as
likely as not to be the one actually running.

The spec-only alternative was rejected on a different ground. A tool's value
is its accumulated behavioral detail -- the sort keys that survive currency
suffixes, the filter that survives a column move, the false-positive guards.
A repo reimplementing from prose gets a tool that differs in a hundred small
ways and re-learns every lesson. The spec is the contract; the vendored code
is the reference implementation.

## Install
Vendored tool with module-level configuration attributes and
sane defaults; host shim of a dozen lines (load via an explicit file path
under a distinct module name to avoid shadowing, set attributes, delegate
to the engine's entry point); the manifest entry notes shim status so the
vendoring audit tracks the engine, not the shim. Every host-side runbook
keeps invoking the shim path — the restructure changes no workflows.

**Related.** [tabular-shared-renderer](tabular-shared-renderer.md) (shared renderer) and [computed-numbers-in-scripts](computed-numbers-in-scripts.md) (generated-block
sync) are the worked examples; [docs-track-models](docs-track-models.md)'s "transformations live in code"
is the same instinct one level up; the check-in flow of the vendoring
playbook is how engine changes propagate.
