applies_to_why: "The distinguishing condition is that branch-sweep OUTPUT is being written -- the engine function that builds a delete link, the committed report it writes, or the document embedding the checkout's safe-to-delete list. All three are paths, so the glob identifies the practice rather than merely accompanying it. Deliberately NOT `**` and deliberately NOT practices/**. The globs alone were the whole routing until 2026-09-21, and that was the bug: they reach an audit and never reach an ordinary reply that names one branch, which is where nearly every branch mention actually happens. The `reply` gate was added for that case; the globs stay for the audit case. Decided: 2026-09-21, when the practice landed at universal; gate added the same day, Morgan."

  practice file rather than write it into both surfaces is the session's, per

## Rule
**A merged-but-undeleted branch is reported as a link that opens GitHub's
branches page already filtered to that one branch** — the row's trash icon is
then on screen and deleting it is one click, with no searching. Never a bare
branch name, and never a link to the branch's tree view, which shows the code
and offers no way to delete it.

    github.com/<owner>/<repo>/branches/all?query=<branch, percent-encoded>

(Written without its `https://` prefix on purpose: a practice file ships
verbatim into every adopting repository, and a complete URL naming a
placeholder owner is still a link a reader can click into nothing.)

`/branches/all` is the **All branches** tab and `?query=` is its filter box.
**The branch name must be percent-encoded.** Branch names routinely contain
`/`, which has to become `%2F` or the filter breaks. In Python that is
`urllib.parse.quote(branch, safe='')` — `safe=''` is the load-bearing part,
since the default leaves `/` alone. Filled in against this repository, a
branch called `claude/tidy-up-abc` becomes
[that one row, with its trash icon](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/branches/all?query=claude%2Ftidy-up-abc).

**Every branch a session names as deletable carries this link — every time,
without exception and without being asked.** One branch mentioned in passing at
the end of an ordinary merge is the common case and the one that keeps getting
missed; a sixty-row audit is the rare one. There is no threshold. If a reply
says a branch can go, the link is in the same sentence. A merged pull request's
own page also carries a Delete branch button and may be given **alongside** the
filtered link, never instead of it — the pull request page is where the code
review lives, and a person who wanted to delete a branch has to find the button
on it.

**And deleting a branch is never blocking.** It is a recommendation — good
housekeeping, worth doing, worth making one click — and it is **never** a
reason to say a session cannot be archived, never an entry in whatever the
reply calls its blockers, and never phrased as something owed. A branch sitting
undeleted costs nothing and breaks nothing; treating it as an outstanding item
turns a courtesy into homework, which is how the whole list stops being read.
Say it as an offer and let it go.

**The session never attempts the deletion itself** — not by any route, and not
after being asked to. [never-delete-a-remote-branch](never-delete-a-remote-branch.md)
says why, and lists the routes that get tried in order when that rule is not in
front of somebody.

**Say which branch it merged INTO, by name, in the same breath.** A branch is
deletable *because* its work landed somewhere, and the offer is unreadable
without that: "both branches are merged and can go" asks the reader to take on
trust that the work reached the branch they care about, which is the one thing
they would actually want to check. Name it — `precedent-beta-v01`, `main` — and
never a role-word standing in for it ("the base branch", "the default branch").
In a repository whose configured default and whose working branch are two
different branches, the role-word and the name point at different places, and
a reader who resolves it the obvious way gets the wrong answer with nothing to
correct them.

Where several branches are listed at once and they all landed on the same
branch, saying so once above the list is enough; where they did not, each row
carries its own.

Three things the report must not get wrong, each of which fails silently:

1. **A branch with no merged pull request is not a deletion candidate**, and
   belongs in a separate list under its own heading. Never mixed in.
2. **A branch whose name is a substring of another branch's name in the same
   repo gets flagged, not linked** — the filter would show more than one row
   and the one-click promise is gone.
3. **Say what success looks like.** After the deletion the filtered page reads
   *"no branches matched"*, which looks like an error and is not.
4. <a id="never-a-tier-branch"></a>**Never a tier branch.** `main`, `staging`, `pre-staging`, staging's old
   name `precedent-beta-v01` and Promote's lock branch
   `precedent-promote-lock` are never offered for deletion, by any route,
   whatever a merge test says: a Promote fast-forwards the lower tiers, so
   they read as merged right after one. A filter that would also show one of
   them on the page says so on the row. Morgan, 2026-09-28 (strength:
   decided): *"it needs to never never offer to delete pre-staging nor
   staging."*

## Detail
### Deciding which branches qualify

Offline, in a clone, the mechanical test is `git merge-base --is-ancestor` and
nothing else is needed — every commit on the branch is already on a protected
branch, so the branch carries nothing. That is what
[tools/very_deep_check.py](../tools/very_deep_check.py) does for the checkout
it runs in.

Over the GitHub API, with no clone, the test is four steps and step 2 is the
one that gets skipped:

1. List all branches; drop the repository's default branch, any protected
   integration branch, and every tier branch in [rule 4 above](#never-a-tier-branch).
2. List **closed** pull requests and keep only those whose `merged_at` is
   non-null. **A closed-unmerged pull request is not a merge.** Closing a pull
   request and deleting its branch destroys the work on it.
3. Intersect on `head.ref`. Where one branch has several merged pull requests,
   report the highest number and its merge date.
4. **Paginate the pull-request list.** A repository with more pull requests
   than one page holds will otherwise under-report, and it under-reports
   *silently* — the call succeeds and the answer is simply short.

### Why the unmerged list is separated rather than annotated

A reader working a long list works it by pattern, not by reading each row's
qualifier. Putting a "this one is not actually merged" note on a row inside a
list of safe deletions is an invitation to click through it, and the cost is
asymmetric: deleting a merged branch loses nothing, and deleting an unmerged
one loses whatever was on it. **Separate headings, separate lists**, and the
unmerged list gets a verdict per row rather than a link
([very-deep-check](very-deep-check.md)'s pass 4 says what a verdict is).

### The substring check

Before emitting a link, compare the branch name against every other branch
name in that repository. If any other name **contains** this one, the filter
resolves to more than one row: flag the branch and say how many rows its
filter will show, rather than promising one click and delivering a search.

The check is cheap — one pass over a list already in hand — and the failure
mode is that the person clicks, sees several rows, and has to work out which
is theirs. That is exactly the friction the link was built to remove.

### Presentation

- **Group by repository, one heading each**, so the person works one browser
  tab at a time.
- **Order the repositories smallest count first.** Clearing a one-branch
  repository and a three-branch repository early makes a long list feel
  finishable; leading with the worst offender makes it feel like homework.
- **Lead with the total**, so the size of the chore is known before the
  scrolling starts.
- **Never truncate the list.** A branch omitted for length is a branch nobody
  deletes, and the whole point is that the list is worked once and shrinks.

### Recovery

GitHub offers a brief **Undo** immediately after a branch deletion, and a
deleted branch's commits stay reachable by SHA until they are garbage
collected. Say the first of those where the list is handed over — a person
who knows a misclick is recoverable works a long list faster than one who
does not.

## Why
**A name is not an affordance.** A list of thirty branch names is a list of
thirty searches: open the repository, open the branches page, type the name,
squint, click. Nobody does that thirty times, so the list is read once and
acted on never — which is how a repository ends up with branches merged
months ago still sitting on its branch page.

**The encoding rule is the detail that gets lost.** It is one argument in one
call, it is invisible when every branch name in front of you is flat, and it
breaks the moment somebody's branch is named `claude/something`. That is
precisely the kind of detail that gets "improved" in one copy of a rule and
not the other, which is why the mechanism lives in this one file and both
surfaces that use it cite it rather than restate it
([fix-the-original](fix-the-original.md)).

**The unmerged list is the part that can do real damage.** Everything else
here costs a person some clicking. Presenting a branch with unlanded commits
as safe to delete costs them the commits.

## Story
**2026-09-21.** A session was asked to audit every repository Morgan owns
carrying a Precedent install. Among its findings were **110 merged-but-undeleted
branches across 9 repositories, the oldest merged on 2026-08-16.**

The first pass reported them the obvious way: branch name, pull-request number,
merge date, grouped by repository. A correct list, and an unusable one — every
row was a search the reader would have to run by hand. Morgan asked for
something better, and what he asked for is the rule above: each branch rendered
as a link that opens the branches page already filtered to it, so the trash
icon is on screen and the deletion is one click.

**The same audit found the failure the separated list exists to prevent.** Of
the branches swept, **37 had no merged pull request at all**. In the one
repository where merge state was checked against a real clone rather than
inferred from the API, **4 of those 5 branches carried unmerged commits** —
work that a list presenting them as deletion candidates would have thrown away.
They were not close calls that a careful reader would have caught; they looked
exactly like the safe rows, because a branch's name says nothing about whether
anything landed.

**The substring check has never caught anything.** Across all 110 branches in
that audit there were zero collisions. It is in the rule anyway because it
costs one pass over a list already in memory, and because its failure is
silent: a filter that returns three rows still returns a page, and the reader
finds out by clicking.

**Later the same day, the link turned out not to be reaching him.** The rule
above had been written for the audit case, and it was routed the way an audit
is routed — off the file paths of the two tools that produce one. So an
ordinary reply that merged a pull request and mentioned the branch at the end
matched nothing, and gave him a branch name. Morgan: *"You always tell me to
delete branches. That's fine. But it needs to always always always give me a
link to the github search results page with the branch right there so I can
just click and delete (it never does that)."* In the same message he named the
other half of it — that the deletion had been arriving as an obligation:
*"it should not consider deleting the branches a 'blocker' - it's something
good to do and recommended, but not blocking."* The occasion widened from
*reporting an audit* to *naming any branch as deletable*, and the routing moved
to the reply gate, which is the moment the naming actually happens.

**The mechanism was already written once, in code, and nowhere in prose.**
[tools/very_deep_check.py](../tools/very_deep_check.py)'s `_branch_url` had
carried the filtered-page form and the `safe=''` encoding since 2026-09-08,
with Morgan's original ask in its docstring — *"make a list of them in the
session including direct links to them so I can delete them"*. Nothing pointed
at it from the practice catalogue, so the fleet-wide audit rediscovered the
same URL from scratch thirteen days later. That rediscovery is what this file
is for.

**2026-09-22, the merge target.** A session closed a reply with *"Both branches
are merged and can go, one click each"* and two correctly filtered links. Both
links were right; the sentence still failed, because it never said what the
branches had merged INTO. Morgan: *"are these merged into precedent-beta-v01?
(Don't we always say which branch they are merged into - I thought that is a
practice?!?!?!? It should be)"*.

It was not, and the near-misses are the reason it reads like it should have
been. This rule already required the link, and required the branch to be named
as a candidate. A separate rule in Morgan's own set already required any branch
mentioned to be named literally rather than by role-word. [go-update](go-update.md)
already required the merge target to be said out loud before a merge — which
that reply did, at the top, naming `precedent-beta-v01` and `main` for the two
merges it had just performed. Every neighbouring rule held, and the deletion
offer at the bottom still arrived with the one fact a reader would check
against missing from it. A branch is deletable BECAUSE its work landed; an
offer that omits where is asking for trust on precisely the question the
offer rests on.

## Install
Two surfaces carry this, and both cite it rather than restating it:

- [chief-of-staff](chief-of-staff.md) sweeps the fleet — every repository the
  person owns carrying a Precedent install.
- [very-deep-check](very-deep-check.md)'s pass 4 sweeps the checkout it is
  running in and the sources that are their own git checkouts, and no further.
  Branch hygiene is per-repository bookkeeping, not a seam finding between two
  repositories, so widening the deep check to the fleet would duplicate what
  the Chief of Staff owns and make an already expensive check more expensive
  for no new judgment.

The engine side is [tools/very_deep_check.py](../tools/very_deep_check.py):
`_branch_url` builds the link, `_delete_row_lines` renders one row, and
`_write_branch_report` writes the committed page. A fleet sweep has no clone to
read and works the API steps above instead.

A third surface joined them on 2026-09-21: **[the-boildown](the-boildown.md)'s
item 5**, the ordinary closing report, which is where all but a handful of
branch mentions actually happen. It is reached through this practice's `reply`
gate rather than a path glob, because a reply has no file to match on.

**Related:** [never-delete-a-remote-branch](never-delete-a-remote-branch.md) —
why the link is the only thing a session can offer;
[fix-the-original](fix-the-original.md) — why the mechanism is one
file and not two;
[repo-is-memory](repo-is-memory.md) — why the per-repo sweep writes a committed
page rather than only printing.
