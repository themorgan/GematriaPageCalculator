## Rule
Current-state documents (the no-revision-history rule) still need
*provenance* — a reader landing on a fresh document that replaced an older
one deserves to know the lineage, and the older document's readers deserve a
pointer forward. Neither note belongs in the documents themselves: the fresh
document opens clean (no "successor to…", no inherited framing debt), and
the superseded one is not edited into a museum label. **Provenance lives in
the repository index**: the index row for the new document names what it
succeeded, the row for the old one names what superseded it, and where the
evolution itself carries lessons worth keeping, they go in a dedicated
evolution-notes document the index points to. Commit messages carry the
rest.

## Detail

## Why
**Why the index and not the document.** A document is read for its content;
an index is read for orientation — lineage is orientation. Provenance notes
inside documents also invert the current-state rule's economics: they start
accurate and decay (the successor gets its own successor; the note never
updates), whereas index rows are touched every time the map is maintained.

## Story
No single dated incident was recorded. The rule resolves a genuine tension
between two other rules, and that tension is what it exists for.

Current-state documents are not supposed to carry revision history, but a
reader landing on a fresh document that replaced an older one still deserves
the lineage, and the superseded document's readers deserve a pointer
forward. Both needs are real; the question is only where the note goes.

Putting it in the documents themselves fails on both ends. The fresh
document stops opening clean, inheriting framing debt in its first
paragraph. The superseded one gets edited into a museum label.

**The economics settle it.** A provenance note inside a document starts
accurate and decays -- the successor gets its own successor, and nothing
updates the note. An index row is touched every time the map is maintained,
so it stays true as a side effect of ordinary work. A document is read for
its content; an index is read for orientation, and lineage is orientation.

## Install
**Related.** The current-state rule (git is the history) this completes;
[search-by-purpose](search-by-purpose.md) (index what you write) supplies the index rows this rides on;
[current-rule-governs](current-rule-governs.md) says the same thing for practices, where a
session acts on the rule in force and never on its lineage.
