## Rule
Rules come in three scopes, and each gets its own home. **Generic** rules
(true of any repo) live in this upstream and its instantiations.
**Repo-local** rules (true only of one repo's subject matter) live in that
repo's instructions files and never leave. Between them sit **domain** rules
— true of any repo running the same *kind* of program (a compliance regime,
a lab workflow, a regulated-filing process) but meaningless outside it.

The decision rule for any new rule: *would this hold in an unrelated repo?*
→ upstream (public scrub applies). *Only in another repo running the same
kind of program?* → domain-scoped, on-demand (see Detail). *Only here?* →
repo-local.

**That axis is about a rule's content, not its home.** Which *set* publishes
it — repo-local, team, individual or universal — is a separate question with
its own tests, and
[rule-level-by-reach](rule-level-by-reach.md) answers it.

## Detail
**Superseded, 2026-09-01, for any repo running Precedent's loader: the
vendored-pack mechanism.** This practice originally routed domain rules by
collecting them into a **practice pack** — a separate vendored tree, with its
own manifest, its own scrub blocklist, and a harness adapter that decided
when to load it (kept below for a repo that has not migrated). Under
Precedent's loader (`PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md`, "How an Agent Knows Which
Practices to Load"), that machinery is redundant: a domain rule is simply a
practice — Universal or Team — whose `applies_to` / `occasion` / `gates`
scope it to that domain's work, routed by the same occasion index and
path-triggered channel as every other on-demand practice. The decision rule
above still holds; only the *implementation* of the middle tier changed.
Recorded in [CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md).

**Closed 2026-09-18: a domain bundle shared across more than one team is a
`shared` source.** The level that used to be called `team` is any set a
repository declares beside the universal one and its own `local/` — a
compliance or lab-workflow domain, a filing pipeline with its tools, a
presentation kit — declared by every repository whose work includes that
subject, whatever team does it. A shared set names the code directories it
ships in its own `precedent-source.json`, and a consumer vendors them with
`checkin.py --source <name>`, so the pack mechanism below is the same shape
under the loader ([source-naming](source-naming.md)).

**The pack mechanism, for a pre-migration consumer repo.** Domain rules are
collected into a **practice pack**: a vendored tree at `process/<pack>/` with
the same anatomy as this upstream (a practices catalog, an install playbook,
extracted tools, harness adapters), tracked by its own manifest at
`process/manifest_<pack>.json` with its own optional scrub blocklist, audited
by the same `practice_audit.py` (it discovers every `process/manifest*.json`).
A pack may **route**: its harness adapter (e.g. an agent skill) declares when
the domain's rules apply, so an agent loads them exactly when doing that
domain's work instead of carrying them in every session.

## Why
**Both misfilings are silent, which is why a middle scope has to exist rather than being approximated by the two ends.**

A domain rule filed as generic carries its vocabulary into an upstream that may be public, and the scrub gate is the only thing standing between it and publication. A domain rule filed as repo-local is safe but stranded: the next repo running the same kind of program needs every one of those rules and has no way to know they already exist, so it re-derives them, differently.

Neither failure announces itself. The first looks like a generous contribution and the second like tidy scoping, and the cost of each shows up somewhere other than where the decision was made. That is what the single decision question is for — *would this hold in an unrelated repo?* — since it can be answered at the moment of writing, by the person who has the context.

## Story
A domain program inside a dependent repo accumulated rules that
were neither generic (they could not be published, and their vocabulary was
all domain) nor repo-local (a second program of the same kind would need
every one of them). With no home of their own they lived interleaved with the
repo's local rules, which meant every session carried them whether relevant
or not, and a future split of the program into its own repo would have meant
re-deriving which rules travel. Vendoring them as a pack made the split a
`git mv` instead of an archaeology project — the same pre-split shaping that
made this upstream's own extraction clean.

## Install
**On Precedent's loader:** write the domain practice as an ordinary Universal
or Shared practice file, with `applies_to` / `occasion` / `gates` scoping it to
the domain's work. Nothing else to install — it is routed the same way as
every other on-demand practice.

**Pre-migration (a repo still vendoring BestPractice the old way):** vendor
the pack tree at `process/<pack>/`; write `process/manifest_<pack>.json`
(schema of [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/INSTALL.md) §5, plus `upstream.scrub_blocklist` — a
path, or `null` to opt a private pack out of the scrub); instantiate the
pack's practices in the repo's real files and record the mapping; install its
harness adapter so the rules load when the domain work happens. The export
gate ([practice-export-loop](practice-export-loop.md)) covers packs too: a thread that improves a domain practice
folds the abstracted form into the pack tree in the same branch, keeping repo
vocabulary out per the pack's blocklist.
