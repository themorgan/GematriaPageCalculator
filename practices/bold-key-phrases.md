## Rule
People don't read; they skim, and bolding makes skimming easy. Bold the key phrases in a document by default, without being asked, scaling with length -- a long paragraph or document is where a skimmer most needs a spine to follow, a short note usually needs little or none.

## Detail
Don't overdo it -- emphasis is a budget, not a decoration; when a lot is bold, nothing is. Two rough tests: someone reading only the bolded phrases should come away with the document's actual argument, and the bolded share of a page should still read as highlighting rather than as the page's normal typeface. A suggestion, not a gate: judge that density against running prose, and let a page whose own structure already carries the emphasis -- headings, short bolded items -- leave its section lead-ins plain. The default is off on an explicit instruction, a recipe saying otherwise, or a register that doesn't take it -- a contract, a filing, an academic or otherwise conventional document -- and out of scope entirely for code, configuration, and other work meant to run.

## Why
This is the mechanism proportional emphasis governs the amount of: that rule says how much weight a point should carry relative to its importance, this one says bolding is the default way to give a point weight.

## Story
Migrated here from RepoPersonalPreferences by the phase-3 private-set
migration. That pack recorded no originating incident for this rule; it is a
stated preference with its reasoning attached, and this Story says so rather
than inventing a failure it never had.

The reasoning is an observation about how the documents this rule governs
are actually consumed: people do not read them, they skim them, and bolding
is what makes a skim land on the argument instead of on whatever the eye
happened to catch. The payoff scales with length, which is why the rule is
about defaulting to bold rather than about a quota.

The counterweight is the part worth keeping: emphasis is a budget. When a
lot of a page is bold, nothing on it is -- the bolding stops being a signal
and becomes texture, and the reader is back to reading everything or
nothing. The two tests in the Rule are both judgment calls by design, since
any threshold precise enough to check mechanically would be wrong for some
register.

The heading-dense clause in the Detail arrived on 2026-09-07, from a page
the rule had been applied to correctly and then outgrown. A pre-launch audit
sweep ([`spec/PRELAUNCH_AUDIT.md`](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/PRELAUNCH_AUDIT.md))
found [`documentation/WHY_PRECEDENT.md`](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/documentation/WHY_PRECEDENT.md)
at a fraction of the bold density of every other outward-facing document
there and added emphasis throughout, which was right for the page as it
stood. The page then grew another group and half again as many items, and at
that density a bold lead-in under every heading marked nothing -- the
headings and the short bolded items were already doing the emphasis. Morgan
asked for the lead-ins to be plain and named the clause a suggestion,
deliberately weak, rather than a gate: a spans-per-100-words ratio cannot
tell a heading-dense page from an under-emphasized one, so a check here
would only re-flag the page he had just fixed.

**On-demand from 2026-10-01.** The reduction pass for precedent-individual's session-start file ([the session-file open item](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-30-session-file-cut-to-4000.md)) noted that, resident, this rule's main cost was bolding in chat replies, which its Rule never asked for: it is about documents. Morgan approved making it on-demand, reached through its existing `**/*.md` path (strength: decided): *"Booked, attach both shared sets, and do both Tier 2 items (and note as a possibility for the future in a Todo the other tier 2 items to consider)"*

## Install
No mechanical check: whether a phrase is "key" and whether the bolded share of a document matches its own two rough tests (a skimmer gets the argument; bold still reads as highlighting, not the normal typeface) is a judgment about that document's own content and audience. A count of bold spans can't tell correct restraint from under- or over-bolding without knowing what the document is actually arguing.
