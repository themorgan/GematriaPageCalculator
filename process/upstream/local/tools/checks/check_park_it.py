"""check_park_it.py -- the mechanical check for local/practices/park-it.md.

# practice: park-it

Scope: tree. The instructions file a session actually reads before it works
(AGENTS.md, or CLAUDE.md where that is the entry point) has to define the
phrase "Drop it" and say what it writes.

Why this is the property worth checking, when the practice itself is about
a conversational trigger: the failure it prevents already happened here to
the other standing phrase. "Go merge" lived in Morgan's private individual
set, a session that had not attached that set met the phrase cold, and --
following AGENTS.md's own instruction at the time -- went and asked him
what it meant. Being asked the same question across sessions is the exact
thing a standing phrase exists to stop, so the phrase generated the
annoyance it was invented to remove. A phrase is only worth having if it
is written where a session reads before it works; this check is that
sentence, made mechanical.

What it cannot see: whether a session that HEARD "Drop it" actually wrote
the disposition line. Nothing in the tree records the utterance, so that
half stays advisory by nature. The grammar of the line it should have
written is enforced separately, by tools/precedent_check.py's
open-item-disposition check.

Contract, shared with every other per-source check script: no arguments;
ROOT derived from this file's own location; exit 0 and print nothing when
clean; exit 1 and print the finding plus the Rule when violated; exit 2
when the check cannot run at all -- reported as SKIPPED, never as a pass.
