"""check_philosophy_is_not_repo_policy.py -- the mechanical check for
local/practices/philosophy-is-not-repo-policy.md.

# practice: philosophy-is-not-repo-policy

Scope: tree. The philosophy/ tree is argument, not policy. Two properties,
both checkable with no false positives:

  1. No practice's ## Rule cites a philosophy/ path, and no practice's
     checked_by points at a script under philosophy/. A rule may EXPLAIN
     itself with an essay (## Why, ## Story, ## Detail, ## Install are all
     fair game and deliberately not scanned) -- it may not be one.
  2. No practice in the exported catalogue (practices/) names philosophy
     in its applies_to. A rule about this repo's own philosophy directory
     is repo-local by construction and belongs in local/practices/.

WHY ONLY THESE TWO. The obvious check -- scan philosophy/ for imperative
prose -- was written first and thrown away. These essays argue for a way
of working, so they are full of correct imperatives ("Argue a genuine
counter-case before building on a stated stance"). A check that fires on
legitimate work teaches the next session to ignore the gate, which
checkable-gets-checked names as worse than no check at all. What IS
crisply checkable is the direction of authority: what a rule is allowed
to lean on.

WHY THIS LIVES UNDER local/, NOT IN tools/precedent_check.py.
precedent_check.py is
vendored verbatim into every consuming repo, and a check about THIS
repository's philosophy/ directory would be a permanent unfixable finding
in repos that have no such directory. A repo-local practice's check
belongs to the repo-local source.

Contract, shared with every other per-source check script: no arguments;
ROOT derived from this file's own location; exit 0 and print nothing when
clean; exit 1 and print the finding plus the Rule when violated; exit 2
when the check cannot run at all -- reported as SKIPPED, never as a pass.
