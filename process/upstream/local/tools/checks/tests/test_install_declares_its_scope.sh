# Four-direction test for check_install_declares_its_scope.py:
#   1. install docs declaring the scope, its counterpart, and the optional
#      files as deferred -- require clean (exit 0) and silent;
#   2. a doc with no scope declaration -- require exit 1 naming THAT;
#   3. a doc declaring the scope but never its counterpart -- require exit 1
#      naming THAT, separately from 2;
#   4. a doc naming project-voice.md and project-visual-identity.md together
#      with no deferral marker -- require exit 1 naming THAT;
#   5. a repo with neither document -- require exit 2 (SKIPPED), never a
#      silent pass: a consuming repo's install path lives upstream.
#
# Direction 6 is the regression that motivated the whole check: prose that
# says "do NOT walk them through" must NOT fire. A check that cannot tell an
# instruction from its negation is worse than no check, and the first draft
# of this one got it wrong -- it flagged three correct passages in the real
# INSTALL.md.
#
# practice: control-asserts-which-failure -- every failing direction asserts
# the printed message, not merely a non-zero exit. A check that exits 1 for
# an unrelated reason (a missing practice file, a traceback) would satisfy
# the exit code alone and prove nothing.
