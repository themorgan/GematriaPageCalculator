# Three-direction test for check_park_it.py:
#   1. an instructions file that never names the phrase -- require the check
#      to fire (exit 1), and to say WHICH half is missing;
#   2. an instructions file carrying both the phrase and the disposition it
#      writes -- require it to stay clean (exit 0) and print nothing;
#   3. a repository with no instructions file at all -- require exit 2
#      (SKIPPED), never a silent pass: there is nowhere for the phrase to
#      live, so the question the check asks was not answered.
#
# Fixtures rather than the real repo: direction 1 asserts a state this repo
# must never be in again, which is the whole point of wiring the check.
#
# practice: control-asserts-which-failure -- every failing direction asserts
# the message, not merely a non-zero exit. A check that exits 1 for an
# unrelated reason (a missing practice file, a traceback) would satisfy the
# exit code alone and prove nothing.
