# it for the first real registered document (spec/PREFORK_AUDIT.md) found
# ModuleNotFoundError: nobody had run this tool successfully in a fresh
# session before either.
#
# ITS PARALLEL ON EVERY OTHER HARNESS IS tools/bootstrap.sh. Codex,
# gemini-cli and grok-build have no SessionStart hook; templates/harness/
# README.md tells each of them to wire that script instead, so a step added
# HERE and not THERE reaches one harness out of four. That is not
# hypothetical: until 2026-09-21 this hook ran seven things and the script
# ran three, and the difference included .precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md --
# every shared and individual practice in force, which AGENTS.md's Standing
# instruction tells every session to read and which no non-Claude session
# had ever been given. Adding a step here? Add it there, or write the

# Repair a single-branch clone's refspec before anything tries to fetch.
# A repository attached mid-session (Claude Code's `add_repo`, and any
# `git clone --single-branch`) is handed exactly one refspec --
# `+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main`. Push a feature branch from
# such a clone and the push genuinely succeeds, but no `origin/<branch>`
# ref is ever written, so every later `git rev-list origin/<branch>..HEAD`
# fails to resolve and the branch reads as "unpushed, no remote
# counterpart" forever -- including to a Stop hook that then blocks the
# turn. Seen 2026-09-06 on two consumer repos whose work was already
# safely on GitHub; the honest-looking remedy (push again) changes
# nothing, because the push was never the problem.
#
# Widening the refspec is local config only: it adds no commits, moves no
# refs, and re-running it is a no-op. Doing it here means the freshness
# block below can actually resolve origin/<branch> on a feature branch,
# which on a single-branch clone it silently could not.

# Make this checkout's HISTORY complete, not just its files.
#
# practice: durable-fix. The container clones this repo `--depth 1`, so every
# file of the branch is present and current and almost none of the past is.
# The files are what a person notices; the past is what the TOOLS read, and
# three of them degrade on a truncated one without ever failing:
# behavioral_replay.py has nothing to replay, doc_lint.py silently narrows
# from "the files changed against the base branch" to "the files not
# committed yet", and precedent_check.py's `scope: tree` checks read an empty
# `git log` as `0 violated` rather than as "could not check"
# (record/GOTCHAS.md#g6, #g8). Git itself is not immune: a branch that is
# merely BEHIND reads as diverged when the two truncated stretches do not
# overlap, which cost a whole session on 2026-09-14 (#g37) before the
# freshness guard learned to deepen before believing its own counts.
#
# Measured 2026-09-14 against this remote through this container's proxy, in
# exactly the order below (refspec widened first, so the deepen reaches every
# branch rather than one): 2.7 MB of history before, 9.5 MB after, 4 seconds.
# That is the whole cost, once per session, which is why this is
# unconditional rather than clever about which sessions need it.
#
# Bounded and never fatal. `timeout` caps a slow or hanging network so a
# session cannot be held at the door, and `--deepen` is the fallback because
# some git policy hooks refuse `--unshallow` outright. A failure reports and
# continues: a session with a short history is worse off than one without,
# and far better off than a session that does not start.
# TODO.md's shallow-clone-self-heal-hardening item, g37's third recurrence.
# ONE bounded attempt used to be the whole mechanism: on failure this printed
# a WARN nothing re-surfaced, and the next chance to fix it was whatever this
# checkout's freshness-guard.sh happened to do on its own (previously: only
# when it looked diverged, never for a checkout that was merely shallow and
# behind). A second, independently-bounded attempt costs nothing when the
# first succeeds, and turns a single transient network hiccup through this
# container's proxy into a recoverable one instead of a silent WARN.

# FRESHNESS LIVES IN .claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh, NOT HERE.
# This file briefly carried its own fetch-and-fast-forward block (added
# 2026-09-06). A parallel session had meanwhile built freshness-guard.sh,
# wired in this repo's own .claude/settings.json at SessionStart,
# UserPromptSubmit and PreToolUse -- so the two ran back to back at every
# startup, fetching twice and racing to fast-forward the same branch. The
# guard's version is also strictly better: it additionally answers "does
# this branch contain everything on its BASE", which is the question that
# catches a branch perfectly in sync with its own remote and still built on
# a stale base. Two copies of a rule is how one of them silently stops
# matching the other, so this one is gone rather than kept in sync by hand.
# The refspec repair above deliberately stays: it is local config only, it
# is idempotent, and it runs before the guard so the guard's comparisons
# can resolve at all on a single-branch clone.

# The practices in force from the TEAM, INDIVIDUAL and REPO-LOCAL sources.
#
# WHY THIS RUNS HERE AND WRITES AN UNTRACKED FILE. precedent.json declares
# more sources than the committed AGENTS.md carries: that block is
# single-source on purpose, because this repository is PUBLIC and private
# practice text may not be committed to it. Measured 2026-09-06
# (spec/PRELAUNCH_AUDIT.md): 43 of the 114 practices in force here reached
# no loading channel at all, so a session was never shown the team's or the
# person's own rules while precedent.json said they bind the work. The
# constraint is on committing that text, not on loading it -- so it is
# generated at session start into .precedent/ (gitignored) instead.
#
# `|| true` and the tool's own always-exit-0 are belt and braces on purpose:
# this file runs under `set -e`, and a session that fails to START because
# an OPTIONAL practice file could not be written is a far worse outcome than
# a session missing it. The tool names any source it could not resolve on
# stderr rather than omitting it silently -- "unreachable" and "has no
# rules" must not look the same.

# The PRIVATE practice sources, when this environment carries a credential.
#
# THIS IS THE ONE STEP THAT CAN RUN BEFORE THE AGENT'S FIRST TURN, and that
# is the whole point of it. A private source normally reaches a hosted

# `add_repo` refuses across owners, reproduced 2026-09-09 as a session's
# very first tool call ("cross-tier adds are not supported in v1"). A
# credential the ENVIRONMENT carries is under no such ordering: git can use
# it here, before anything else runs, which is why setting
# PRECEDENT_GIT_TOKEN is the durable fix and `add_repo` is the per-session
# one (practice: durable-fix).
#
# The shared sets are cloned as SIBLINGS, from $PRECEDENT_SOURCE_BASE_URL/<name>
# (or /<repo>, when the declaration says the repository is called something
# else), because that is how tools/precedent_resolve.py resolves one. The
# individual set needs nothing here: precedent_resolve.py's own self-heal
# already re-runs its bootstrap hook, and with a token set that attempt now
# succeeds where it used to fail for want of access.

# that session's own working tree, and it still never commits or pushes --
# publishing stays "Update Vendors" or a person reading the diff by hand.
# See that file's docstring for the fuller record.
#
# A source with its own uncommitted changes is left alone rather than
# refreshed -- precedent_refresh_sources.py checks for that before writing

# ---- commit identity, for EVERY Precedent repo in the session
#
# practice: session-bootstrap, and the incident is this repo's own.
#
# A SessionStart hook fires for the session's PRIMARY repo only. A sibling
# attached with `add_repo` is just a directory on disk -- AGENTS.md's
# gotchas already say every guarantee that hook provides is absent there.
# The consequence nobody had joined up: the mechanism that sets a commit's
# AUTHOR and TIMEZONE lives in the individual practice set's own
# `bootstrap/commit-identity.sh`, so in a session whose primary repo is
# THIS one, no attached set gets an identity at all. Each one silently
# keeps the container's bot account and its UTC clock.
#
# 2026-09-07 it produced both halves in one turn: a commit authored as the
# container's agent (caught before it was pushed) and, an hour later, a
# merge commit stamped +0000 that reached main and had to be grandfathered
# by SHA. Setting it by hand had been the workaround all session, which is
# exactly the "instruction competing with a default, on every commit,
# forever" that commit-identity.sh's own header says not to rely on.
#
# THE INFORMATION STAYS IN ONE PLACE. This does not copy a name, an address
# or a zone anywhere: it runs the individual set's own script, which reads
# that set's `identity.json` -- still the single declaration
# (registry-source-of-truth). All this adds is REACH: the same script, once
# per repo, with CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR pointing at each. The script is built
# for exactly this (it is meant to be installed in shared repositories that
# name no person) and is idempotent, so re-running costs nothing.
