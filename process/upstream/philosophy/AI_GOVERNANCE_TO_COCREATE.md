# AI Governance to Co-Create

*Governance for the AI systems themselves: how to configure, build, and
run them so co-creation —
[`co-create-dont-delegate`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#co-create-dont-delegate) —
is the default, not something a disciplined person manufactures by hand.
[Company Building Rules](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md) makes the case for
running a company this way; this document is one level down, about the
systems. See also [Our Philosophy](OUR_PHILOSOPHY.md) (the theory),
[Reasons Why](REASONS_WHY.md) (the payoffs), and
[Humans at Our Best](HUMANS_AT_OUR_BEST.md) (what stays human).*

## Memory & Context

<a id="durable-state-default"></a>

**1. Persistent, versioned, greppable state should be the default shape,
not a special case.** Context only behaves like capital
([`capital-asset`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#capital-asset)) if it
outlives the session that made it — durable, diffable state should beat
ephemeral chat by default — what a private window loses
([`private-chat-is-lost-knowledge`](REASONS_WHY.md#private-chat-is-lost-knowledge)),
and what [`version-control-and-audit-trail`](#version-control-and-audit-trail)
is built on.

<a id="automatic-rule-extraction"></a>

**2. Automatic rule extraction should be a standing capability, not a
manual habit.** Distill protocols, rules, and preferences straight out of
the interaction — the guidance, the correction — instead of waiting for
someone to write policy by hand; this repo's shared and individual practice
sources (precedent-shared-repo-maintenance, precedent-individual — see
[spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](../spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md)) run this continuously
([`rules-generated-automatically`](OUR_PHILOSOPHY.md#rules-generated-automatically);
[`writing-stops-competing-with-doing`](REASONS_WHY.md#writing-stops-competing-with-doing)).

<a id="coldstart-test"></a>

**3. A coldstart test, run like any other check.** Can a fresh session,
given only the memory store, reconstruct the current state of any live
decision? If not, the transcription
([`transcribe-everything`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#transcribe-everything))
failed somewhere specific and locatable.

<a id="active-resurfacing"></a>

**4. Resurfacing should be active, not just searchable.** A system that
only answers when asked misses what nobody thought to ask — the better
version notices "you decided X six weeks ago" unprompted, when it's
relevant now. What makes such a decision worth resurfacing is that it
carries its own case
([`decisions-carry-their-situation`](OUR_PHILOSOPHY.md#decisions-carry-their-situation)).

<a id="version-control-and-audit-trail"></a>

**5. Version control and an audit trail, on the working material
itself.** Every change lands as a commit with an author, a time and a
diff, so *who changed this, when, and what did it say before* is a
question with an answer rather than a reconstruction from memory
([`durable-state-default`](#durable-state-default) is what makes that
possible; this is what it is for).

## Interaction Design

<a id="push-back-as-config-switch"></a>

**6. Push-back as a configuration switch, not a personality quirk.**
Argue a genuine counter-case on writing/thinking work, comply on
technical execution — the switch should track task shape, not sit fixed
at the system level, where a rule built strict on purpose under-serves the
case in front of it ([`boundary-pushing`](HUMANS_AT_OUR_BEST.md#boundary-pushing)).

<a id="three-reflexes-in-system-prompt"></a>

**7. The reflex belongs in the system prompt, not just a human's habit.**
An agent that asks itself "have I done this shape before" mid-task, and
says so, does more of
[`think-in-workflows`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#think-in-workflows)'s
work than a person remembering to ask.

<a id="argue-in-the-open"></a>

**8. Argue in the open.** An AI reviewer that holds a half-formed
position and invites disagreement, rather than posting a clean
finished-looking suggestion, keeps the disagreement itself in the record.
The system-level form of [`arguing-with-the-model`](OUR_PHILOSOPHY.md#arguing-with-the-model).

## Interface

<a id="chat-is-primary-interface"></a>

**9. Chat is the primary interface to every document, not a shortcut
around them.** The AI creates and organizes the documents; humans can
edit them directly, but most work happens by asking and guiding it in
chat — docs are its memory, chat is where people work
([`inputs-and-outputs-separated`](#inputs-and-outputs-separated) is that
line held). Practised,
[`ai-chat-as-intermediary`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#ai-chat-as-intermediary); as a pillar,
[`chat-is-the-entry-point`](CORE_PILLARS.md#chat-is-the-entry-point).

<a id="inputs-and-outputs-separated"></a>

**10. Total separation of inputs and outputs.** What people say — the
instructions, the arguments, the corrections — is kept apart from what
the system produces, so a draft is never mistaken for a directive and
either can be re-read on its own terms. The same line
[`chat-is-primary-interface`](#chat-is-primary-interface) draws between
chat and documents.

<a id="cloud-not-local"></a>

**11. Everything runs cloud-based, with no local machine risk.** Work
that happens in a hosted session leaves nothing on a laptop to lose,
leak, or be the only copy of — provided the formats and accounts are yours
([`open-formats-you-own`](REASONS_WHY.md#open-formats-you-own)). A new person is one
repository access away from working, not a day of installing things, which
is what [`groups-not-individuals`](OUR_PHILOSOPHY.md#groups-not-individuals) needs to be
true, and what lets the work move with the person from a laptop to a phone
([`cloud-first`](OUR_PHILOSOPHY.md#cloud-first)).

## Workflow & Cost Sensitivity

<a id="automatic-workflow-detection"></a>

**12. Automatic workflow-candidate detection.** Mine the history itself —
commits, sessions, transcripts — for recurring task shapes instead of
relying on a human noticing "this is the third time." Turns
[`think-in-workflows`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#think-in-workflows)'s
judgment call into a standing job.

<a id="cost-awareness-situational"></a>

**13. Cost-awareness should be situational, inferred by the system, not a
fixed global policy.** The right posture varies by person and moment —
sometimes
[`build-five-kill-four`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#build-five-kill-four)'s
lavishness fits better. The harder problem is inferring which situation
applies, not applying one policy everywhere.

<a id="enforcement-not-vigilance"></a>

**14. Enforcement instead of vigilance.** A rule that survives only
because somebody remembers it fails on the first busy day — the same day
[`writing-stops-competing-with-doing`](REASONS_WHY.md#writing-stops-competing-with-doing)
loses on. Written as a check that fails loudly it costs nothing to keep and
never has an off day;
[`structural-ai-voice-check`](#structural-ai-voice-check) is the clearest
case here.

## Voice & Output

<a id="structural-ai-voice-check"></a>

**15. A structural "sounds like AI" check.**
[`no-ai-voice`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#no-ai-voice) names the actual
fingerprints — the throat-clearing opener, "not just X, it's Y," the
bolded summary nobody asked for. Those are mechanical enough to check for
before publishing, rather than relying on a human catching it every time:
[`enforcement-not-vigilance`](#enforcement-not-vigilance) applied to
voice.

<a id="non-uniform-confidence"></a>

**16. Confidence should look non-uniform, because it isn't.** If every
claim reads with the same even prose confidence,
[`hire-for-drive`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#hire-for-drive)'s "find the one false paragraph"
skill has nothing to grab onto. Flag the weaker claims — a hedge, a
citation, an assumption — rather than let them read as settled.

## Surfacing Blind Spots

<a id="ai-hunts-dark-processes"></a>

**17. Configure the AI to hunt its own dark processes.** Have it
periodically list workflows whose only interface is a human inbox —
including its own — and propose an addressable alternative, per
[`no-dark-processes`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#no-dark-processes).

<a id="periodic-checkins-not-expiry"></a>

**18. Rotation and temp workflows get periodic check-ins, not baked-in
expiry.** A hard sunset date, taken literally from
[`structurally-human`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#structurally-human),
forces an end even when a workflow is going well. Better: a recurring,
low-cost reminder — "is this still needed, still the right shape?"

## Keeping the Corpus Honest

<a id="contradiction-scanning-recurring"></a>

**19. Contradiction-scanning as a recurring job, not a one-off pass.** A
compounding corpus
([`capital-asset`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#capital-asset)'s own
metaphor) rots quietly if nothing re-reads it for internal disagreement —
worth standing up as a periodic pass, not something that only runs once
someone thinks of it.

<a id="provider-neutrality-hedge"></a>

**20. Provider-neutrality is a hedge on
[`capital-asset`](COMPANY_BUILDING_RULES.md#capital-asset), not a
preference.** Context built against one vendor's tooling shouldn't be
strandable by a provider switch — the capital asset is the context, not
the platform it's sitting in today. What the hedge looks like in practice:
[`open-formats-you-own`](REASONS_WHY.md#open-formats-you-own).

<a id="conversation-privacy"></a>

**21. Absolute privacy of individual conversations with your AI
assistants.** Chat conversations are like Google searches: deeply
personal. The learnings, documentation and artifacts are shared, but
never the conversations themselves. What leaves a conversation is what
it produced, which is why the knowledge that
[`private-chat-is-lost-knowledge`](REASONS_WHY.md#private-chat-is-lost-knowledge)
warns about has to be written out of the chat and into the repository,
rather than the chat being opened up.
