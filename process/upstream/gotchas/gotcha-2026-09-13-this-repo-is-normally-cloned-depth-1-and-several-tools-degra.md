## Symptom

This repo is normally cloned `--depth 1`, and several tools degrade rather than fail on that.

## Story

**This repo is normally cloned `--depth 1`, and several tools degrade rather
than fail on that.** [tools/behavioral_replay.py](../tools/behavioral_replay.py)
divided by the replayable-commit count and took the whole harness down with a
`ZeroDivisionError` on a one-commit clone — the exact environment a fresh
session starts in. It now reports `REPLAY_STATUS: DEGRADED` instead. On the
same clone `origin/main` does not exist, so doc_lint's
changed-vs-default-branch scope quietly becomes changed-vs-`HEAD`: it checks
your uncommitted files and nothing else. Fix both with a bounded `git fetch
--depth=500 origin <branch>`; some git policy hooks block `--unshallow`, and a
bounded fetch works either way.

**Since 2026-09-14 the primary repo does this for you**, in
[.claude/hooks/session-start.sh](../.claude/hooks/session-start.sh): a shallow
clone is deepened at session start, before anything reads history, bounded by
`timeout` and falling back to `--deepen` where `--unshallow` is refused.
Measured against this remote: 2.7 MB of history before, 9.5 MB after, 4
seconds. **What it does NOT cover is every case this entry is about** — a
sibling attached mid-session runs none of its own hooks
([g15](../record/GOTCHAS.md#g15)), a CI checkout is its own shallow clone, and a source set has no
such hook at all. In any of those, the manual fetch above is still the fix, and
a tool reporting a suspiciously clean result is still the symptom.

**Update, 2026-09-21 — deepening is NOT durable within a session.** A
session unshallowed this clone with `git fetch --unshallow origin`,
confirmed `is-shallow-repository false`, and did ~40 minutes of work.
`.git/shallow` was then rewritten mid-session and the clone was shallow
again, silently: the next `git diff main...branch` failed with
`fatal: no merge base`, and a `git log A..B` count that had read 207 read
98. Nothing announced the change.

What rewrote it was not established. Several things in this tree fetch with
an explicit bound and are the obvious candidates —
[.claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh](../.claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh)
fetches `--depth=200`, and
[tools/precedent_upstream_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/83819879ff3de347227bf24c3a67a7546fb07f6e/tools/precedent_upstream_check.py),
[tools/precedent_engine_freshness.py](../tools/precedent_engine_freshness.py)
and [tools/precedent_beta_watermark_check.py](../tools/precedent_beta_watermark_check.py)
each fetch `--depth=50` — but which one fired was not measured, and the
freshness guard's own comment claims it passes `--depth` only to a clone
that is already shallow. Treat the culprit as unknown.

**The practical consequence:** deepening once at the top of a session is not
enough. **Re-check `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` immediately
before any merge-base, `A...B` diff, or ancestry claim you intend to act
on**, however recently you deepened — and treat `fatal: no merge base` or a
commit count that dropped as this, not as a rewritten branch.
