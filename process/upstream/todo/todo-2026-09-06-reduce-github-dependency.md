## What

- <a id="reduce-github-dependency"></a>**Reduce GitHub dependency when ready.** The layer itself is plain git
   + markdown + Python; GitHub specifics are the worked examples (PRs,
   Actions, Issues, branch rulesets). When priorities allow, document
   Gitea equivalents (Gitea Actions is workflow-compatible; Issues and
   branch protection have counterparts) so a repo can move hosts without
   losing the practices. Deliberately below the Actions/Issues items
   above: deeper GitHub integration now is acceptable, since equivalents
   can be added later.

## How It Closes

(not yet stated by the migration -- a session filling this in should read ## What and say what has to be true for `status` to become `done`.)

## Notes

2026-09-16: noted date is a floor, not exact -- this item predates anchor tracking (every anchor was retrofitted 2026-09-06) and its true creation date is unknown. Migrated from TODO.md by tools/todo_migrate.py.
