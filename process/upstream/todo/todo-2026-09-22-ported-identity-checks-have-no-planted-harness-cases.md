## What

- <a id="ported-identity-checks-have-no-planted-harness-cases"></a>**`tools/checks/check_commit_author.py` and
    `check_buenos_aires_dates.py`, ported to this repo from
    precedent-individual (commit `9d16b6a`) to back a new push-time
    identity gate, have no planted-violation case in
    `tools/verify_harness.py`'s own test suite.** `verify_harness.py --as-ci`
    reports it directly: "every registered check has a planted case here
    (untested: ['check_buenos_aires_dates', 'check_commit_author'])".

    Both scripts were verified BEHAVIORALLY instead, in throwaway clones,
    the same session they were added: a bot-authored/wrong-offset commit
    is flagged before it reaches a remote, silently drops out of scope
    once a remote-tracking ref reaches it, and
    `PRECEDENT_CHECK_FULL_HISTORY=1` still catches it either way; the
    push-gate denies a bad push and allows a clean one. That is real
    evidence the mechanism works, but it is not the same guarantee as a
    planted case living in the harness's own suite, checked on every
    future change the way every other registered check here already is.

    Deferred rather than closed the same session: the existing planted
    cases in this harness are a substantial, carefully-built body of work
    (throwaway git fixtures, negative controls, exact-message assertions)
    and matching that bar for two scripts was judged bigger than this
    session's remaining scope, with the git-identity fix Morgan asked for
    already the far larger piece of the turn.

## How It Closes

`verify_harness.py --as-ci`'s heavy shard reports zero untested registered
checks, with a real planted-violation case (and a planted clean case) for
each of `check_commit_author` and `check_buenos_aires_dates`.

## Notes

2026-09-22: filed the same session that ported the two scripts and their
push-gate, on the finding named above.

2026-09-22, same session, on Morgan asking whether this needs testing
"every time" or belongs in `very-deep-check` instead: **it is already
checked every time, not something to defer.** `verify_harness.py
--as-ci`'s heavy shard runs `check_precedent_check_fires`'s "every
registered check has a planted case" assertion on every invocation, which
is what surfaced this in the first place -- not a `very-deep-check`-only
pass. `very-deep-check`'s own Pass 2 item 20 covers a related but
different question (does a newly-filed INCIDENT have something that now
catches a recurrence); this is a newly-added CHECK with no fixture at
all, which the harness's own standing suite already asks about on every
run and will keep failing on until the fixtures actually exist. The open
item is real, unfinished work (write the fixtures), not a question of
which gate should be asking.

## Closed 2026-09-28

Its own condition is met, found by the very deep check's pass 4: tools/verify_harness.py carries planted cases for both ported checks; `verify_harness.py --all` reports every planted case run.
