## What

- <a id="gate-and-paths-unreachable-source"></a>~~**`precedent_gate.py` and `precedent_paths.py` don't flag an unreachable    materialized source either — only `precedent_show.py` does, 2026-09-06.**~~
    **Done (2026-09-06).** Both read `practices/*.md` directly via
    `split_practices._read_practice_file` rather than shelling out to
    `precedent_show.py` (confirmed by grep, not assumed), so the
    reachability note that tool carries (`_source_unreachable_note`) never
    reached a practice loaded through the gate-triggered or path-triggered
    channel — only the on-demand, `precedent show SLUG`-invoked channel got
    it. **The design call, stated before picking (same bar as PR #114's own
    design section):** three options existed — (a) route both files through
    `precedent_show.py` as a subprocess, (b) duplicate
    `_materialize_manifest`/`_source_unreachable_note`'s logic into each, or
    (c) import `precedent_show.py` directly and call its two helpers.
    (a) means re-parsing `precedent_show.py`'s own `"### slug\n<body>"`
    stdout format back into structured data for no reason, purely to get a
    note the caller could already print itself once it has the same
    function. (b) is exactly the drift this repo's own
    [engine-plus-host-shims](../practices/engine-plus-host-shims.md) practice
    exists to prevent — two copies of the same reachability logic that can
    silently diverge the next time one is fixed and the other isn't.
    (c) costs nothing new: both files already `import split_practices as sp`
    for the same reason (a sibling module in the same `tools/` directory),
    so importing `precedent_show as ps` the same way and calling
    `ps._materialize_manifest(root)` / `ps._source_unreachable_note(manifest, slug)`
    is the same discipline already in use, not a new one. Chose (c).
    Verified: [tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py)'s
    `check_show_flags_unreachable_materialized_source` extended from 8 to
    12 stated cases (a reachable and an unreachable case added for each of
    the gate and path channels, alongside the pre-existing
    `precedent_show.py` cases) — all 12 pass.

## Notes

noted date is a floor, not exact -- this item predates anchor tracking and its true creation date is unknown. 2026-09-19: this item was dropped by the 2026-09-16 todo/gotcha migration
(`9a08363b`) along with 53 others -- see
[`todo-2026-09-19-migration-dropped-54-items.md`](todo-2026-09-19-migration-dropped-54-items.md)
for the full catalogue and root cause. Recreated verbatim from
`git show 9a08363b^:TODO.md`, with its relative links repointed one level
up into `../` and its old-style `TODO.md`-anchor citations repointed to the
real `todo/` files they now resolve to.
