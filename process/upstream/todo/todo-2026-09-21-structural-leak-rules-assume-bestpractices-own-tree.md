## What

[tools/leak_gate.py](../tools/leak_gate.py)'s STRUCTURAL layer is written on
a premise it states outright: *"Precedent holds universal practices and
nothing else."* That is true of **this** repository's public tree and false
of every repo the same gate is now vendored into.

Measured 2026-09-21: a session installing `leak-gate.yml` into two real
practice sets smoke-tested it first, and it was **red on arrival** in both —
exit 1, 7 hits and 13 hits, with an isolated `HOME` so no individual source
resolved and no blocklist applied. Nothing was wrong with either repo's
content.

- **`precedent.json: an email address`**, 3 hits in each. **Fixed the same
  day**: a repo's own ROOT `precedent.json` / `precedent-source.json` /
  `identity.json` no longer trips the email rule, since those files exist to
  declare who owns the repo. Root only — a NESTED copy is a vendored private
  set and is still caught.
- **`candidates/.gitkeep` and `candidates/…md`** — *"a candidates/outbox
  directory"*. **Not fixed, and this item is about that.**

## Why It Matters

A practice source set legitimately carries a tracked `candidates/` outbox;
so, plausibly, does a consuming repo with its own drafting workflow. The
`individual/`, `personal/` and `private/` directory rules have the same
shape. `CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES` ships `leak-gate.yml` to the `source` kind
regardless, so the gate arrives pre-failed in exactly the repositories it is
meant to protect — and **a gate that is red on arrival is a gate somebody
switches off.**

This is the fourth defect in this template chain with the same root: a
thing written for one repo, shipped to a different kind of repo, carrying
its origin's assumptions with it.

## What Would Close It

A decision, then a small change. **The obvious discriminators do not work,
and this is why it was not guessed at:**

- **File presence cannot tell a public universal tree from a private set.**
  BestPractice itself carries BOTH `precedent.json` and
  `precedent-source.json`; so do all three shared sets, measured the same
  day.
- **Self-declared `visibility` must not gate a LEAK check.** That is
  precisely the bug corrected in `leak-gate.yml.template` on 2026-09-20,
  where two public repos declared themselves private. The workflow now takes
  visibility from GitHub — but [leak_gate.py](../tools/leak_gate.py) also runs in a local pre-push
  hook, where no GitHub context exists.

Plausible answers, none chosen: scope the directory rules to the repo that
declares itself the universal publisher; move them out of STRUCTURAL into a
layer a repo opts into; or give them the same per-path exemption-with-reason
mechanism `ci_workflow_outside_vendoring_exempt` already uses, so a repo
says once, with a reason, that its `candidates/` is deliberate.

Until then `leak-gate.yml` stays uninstalled in the practice sets, which is
where it was already held.

## Resolved, 2026-09-21

**Option C, chosen and built:** `leak_structural_exempt` in a repo's own
`precedent.json` (or `precedent-source.json`) — a list of `{path, reason}`
entries. A path under a declared prefix is not flagged by the structural
PATH rules. **The reason is mandatory**: an entry without one is ignored, so
the exemption cannot be taken silently.

**The rule never weakens for a class of repo**, which is why this was chosen
over scoping by kind. Each repo that genuinely needs such a directory says
so once, in writing, where a person reading the config can see it — the same
discipline `ci_workflow_outside_vendoring_exempt` already uses.

**Scope, verified against six fixtures:** it covers PATH rules only and
never content; a prefix matches on a segment boundary and at the repo root,
so `candidates` exempts a file directly under it and not a nested `docs/candidates/` path;
and it exempts only what it names — `outbox/` and `personal/` still fire
under a `candidates` exemption.

`strength: decided` — *"Approved for all, go update."*
