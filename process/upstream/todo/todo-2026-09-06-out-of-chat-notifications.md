## What

- <a id="out-of-chat-notifications"></a>**Out-of-chat change notifications for members.** In-chat catch-up is
   now a convention (the instructions template's session-start
   catch-up), but a member who hasn't opened a session learns nothing.
   Evaluate a GitHub Actions job that emails a plain-language digest of
   merged changes (or leans on GitHub's built-in Watch notifications,
   documented in the members' page) — as of 2026-08, unexplored.

## How It Closes

(not yet stated by the migration -- a session filling this in should read ## What and say what has to be true for `status` to become `done`.)

## Notes

2026-09-16: noted date is a floor, not exact -- this item predates anchor tracking (every anchor was retrofitted 2026-09-06) and its true creation date is unknown. Migrated from TODO.md by tools/todo_migrate.py.
