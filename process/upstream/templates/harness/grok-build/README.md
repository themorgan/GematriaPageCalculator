# Grok Build adapter

**New 2026-09-17, researched but not yet run.** Grok Build (`xai-org/grok-build`)
is xAI's own terminal coding agent — a real product with shell and file
access, not the plain chat-only Grok this repo's other guides used to treat
as unverified. Everything below is grounded in xAI's own current
documentation, found and read on 2026-09-17; nothing here has been
confirmed by an actual Grok Build session working in this repo yet — that
is exactly what [spec/PROVIDER_PORTABILITY_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/PROVIDER_PORTABILITY_PLAN.md)'s
Phase 5 test is for.

Grok reads **`AGENTS.md` natively** — no pointer file needed; xAI's own
docs say it also reads `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/` (skills, agents, Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers, hooks, rules) directly, which is broader
compatibility than Codex or Gemini CLI claim. **Whether that extends to
actually firing this repo's `.claude/hooks/*.sh` the way Claude Code's own
`SessionStart` protocol does was unverified**, and an open bug report
(Bootstrap, below) now says it does not on Grok Build 1.0.3: hooks
imported through that compatibility show as loaded and never run.

Wiring the rest:

- **Bootstrap:** Grok Build has its own hook system. What this page said
  on 2026-09-17 (one `.grok/hooks.json` file, `$GROK_EVENT` and friends in
  the environment) does not match what a web search quoted from xAI's hooks
  page on 2026-09-28: events named `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`,
  `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `SessionEnd` and more; hook files in
  `~/.grok/hooks/*.json` or `<project>/.grok/hooks/*.json`; `GROK_HOOK_EVENT`,
  `GROK_SESSION_ID` and `GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT` in the environment; tool
  events carrying `toolName` and `toolInput` in camelCase; and a
  `PreToolUse` that blocks only on exit 2 or a top-level
  `decision: "deny"`, allowing on anything else, a timeout included.
  **All of that is unverified**: the page itself was not reachable from the
  session that checked. **And an open bug says project hooks do not fire
  anyway.**
  [xai-org/plugin-marketplace#236](https://github.com/xai-org/plugin-marketplace/issues/236),
  filed 2026-08-13 against Grok Build 1.0.3 and still open on 2026-09-28,
  reports that only `~/.grok/hooks/*.json` is dispatched: hooks from
  plugins and from the Claude Code compatibility import show as loaded and
  trusted, and never run. So nothing here ships a template. Whoever wires
  a session-start hook to `bash tools/bootstrap.sh` (the script Codex and
  Gemini CLI both run) should put it in `~/.grok/hooks/`, check the
  current hooks reference first, and record what they saw in
  [../LEDGER.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/harness/LEDGER.md).
- **Pre-approved commands:** unresearched — not found in what this pass
  covered.
- **Commit identity and signing:** `tools/bootstrap.sh` calls
  `.claude/hooks/commit-identity.sh` automatically, the moment a
  session-start hook is wired per the Bootstrap step above — same
  guarantee level as Codex and Gemini CLI (hard if the hook is actually
  configured, none at all if it isn't). See [../LEDGER.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/harness/LEDGER.md)
  for this mechanism's own history. One thing specific to Grok worth
  testing directly: `commit-identity.sh`'s GitHub-account-lookup fallback
  now sends a bearer token when `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set in the
  environment (2026-09-17) — whether a Grok Build session's own
  environment carries either of those by default is exactly the kind of
  thing Phase 5's test would answer and this research pass could not.

**Wired into [../LEDGER.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/harness/LEDGER.md)'s enforced transfer tracking on
2026-09-21.** This section used to say the opposite, and the deferral was
half right: extending an enforced check on unverified assumptions about a
hooks syntax nobody has confirmed would indeed have been a guess. But the
ledger records *verdicts*, not wirings, and "nobody has confirmed whether
this can transfer" is a verdict — a more useful one than an absent column.
So the fourth member-directory went into
[`tools/precedent_check.py`](../../../tools/precedent_check.py)'s list,
every row dated before this adapter existed carries a backfilled cell
saying so, and the unverified-hooks caveat stayed exactly where it belongs:
in the Bootstrap bullet above, which since 2026-09-28 quotes the
documented syntax but still ships no wiring nobody has seen work.

This adapter's row in [../PARALLELS.md](../PARALLELS.md) is the other half:
what Claude Code does that this harness does not, mechanism by mechanism.

## The Markdown Check Does Not Run Here

**Read this before assuming your documents are checked.** On 2026-09-21
Precedent's Markdown lint left GitHub Actions entirely and was replaced by
`.claude/hooks/doc-lint-gate.sh`, which refuses a `git commit` whose staged
Markdown fails [doc_lint.py](../../../tools/doc_lint.py). Grok Build
documents a `PreToolUse` event that could carry it (unverified, see
Bootstrap above), but not unchanged: the script reads `tool_input.command`,
and Grok sends `toolInput` in camelCase, so wired as-is the script would
see no command and let every commit through. It would need a shim that
renames the field, and, per the open dispatch bug, a home in
`~/.grok/hooks/`. **If you verify the hooks reference and wire it, say so in
[../LEDGER.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/harness/LEDGER.md) and [../PARALLELS.md](../PARALLELS.md).**
Codex (since 2026-09-28) already runs this gate from its own hooks file.

**So on this adapter, nothing checks your Markdown before it reaches a
shared branch** — not the hook, and not CI, because the workflow the hook
replaced is retired and deleted. This is the first adapter gap with that
property. Every earlier one cost you a guard you never had; this one costs
you a guard that was there last week.

Do both of these. Not one:

1. **Run it yourself before every commit:**
   `python3 tools/doc_lint.py <the markdown you touched>`. Nothing will
   remind you.
2. **Put a GitHub check back**, because step 1 is a habit and a habit is
   what the hook exists to replace. Copy
   [../../github-actions/light-check.yml.template](../../github-actions/light-check.yml.template)
   to `.github/workflows/light-check.yml`, set its `CUSTOMIZE` command to
   `python3 tools/doc_lint.py` and its `paths:` to `"**/*.md"`, then enable
   Actions for the repository at **Settings → Actions**.

**Doing only the first is the arrangement that just failed upstream.** "A
session is supposed to run the check before committing" was written down
and followed for months, and still nothing refused a commit that skipped
it — which was only ever safe because CI was behind it.
