# Repository instructions — read me first

<!-- Template: instantiate per templates/document-project/README.md,
     which follows Precedent INSTALL.md §0 ("Installing directly onto the
     Precedent loader"). This is the document-project variant of
     templates/AGENTS.md.loader.template: the access-restriction and persona
     content below comes from spec/CONTRIBUTOR_ACCESS.md verbatim
     (don't re-derive it), and the candidate-capture bullet comes from
     spec/DOCUMENT_WORK_PRACTICE_CAPTURE.md. Replace <angle-bracket>
     placeholders with this project's real content; keep the section
     structure and the generated-block markers exactly as they appear below. -->

**Orientation: read `MAP.md` first** — the repository map. It covers the key
deliverables and indexes which documents back each part of each one.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: precedent-loader -->
<!-- END GENERATED -->

<!-- The block above is written by `python3 tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo .`
     (INSTALL.md §0 step 5) — never hand-edit between the markers; the
     regeneration check fails loudly on drift. Leave the markers themselves
     exactly as shown, on their own lines, with nothing between them until
     the tool fills them in. -->

## Where things are (quick index — check here BEFORE searching the repo)

| Looking for… | Go to |
|---|---|
| Canonical names for this project's terms — use these names, don't invent new ones | `GLOSSARY.md` |
| The document(s) this project is producing | `<path>` |
| Open items: analyses, verifications, decisions | `TODO.md` |
| Which practice sources are in force, and where each is vendored or resolved from | `precedent.json` |

## Document workflow

<!-- Fill in with the real project once a document exists: what's being
     written, where the working drafts live, who reviews. Documents live as
     plain text/markdown files in this repo, edited through ordinary commits
     and PRs — the same working method as any other Precedent repo, just
     applied to prose instead of code. -->

### Build-environment gotchas — do NOT rediscover these

Environment and tooling traps are written down one per file under
[gotchas/](gotchas/), each with what failed, what it cost, and the fix
(practice `environment-gotchas`). **None of that catalogue is copied into
this file**: hit a confusing, hard-to-explain failure, and before
concluding it is new, grep for it —
`grep -ril '<a keyword from what you are seeing>' gotchas/`. Add one as
`gotchas/gotcha-<date>-<slug>.md` with `## Symptom`, `## Story` and
`## Fix`, and mirror its fix into the bootstrap script (practice
`session-bootstrap`) so it applies itself. The bullets below are standing
instructions for this repo, not gotchas.

- At session start, run `bash tools/bootstrap.sh` before other work. Claude
  Code runs it for you from its SessionStart hook, on the web and
  locally (locally it skips the package install and the machine-wide git
  setup); in other harnesses, run it yourself unless your adapter wires it — Precedent's
  [templates/harness/](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/tree/main/templates/harness)
  says which can.
- **Keep `AGENTS.md`'s generated block current.** Before relying on it,
  run `python3 tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo . --check` — it exits non-zero
  if any declared source (`precedent.json`) has moved since the block was
  last regenerated. Re-run without `--check` to refresh it, review the
  diff, and commit.

- **A brand-new session on this repo alone has no git read access to this
  project's shared sets** — session repo access is scoped per session, never
  inherited just because `precedent.json` names a repo. No token or secret is
  involved: the tool that grants a session this access rides the same GitHub
  identity already behind the session, so it only ever succeeds because that
  person is already a collaborator on the target repo. **At the very start of
  every session, before running `tools/bootstrap.sh`, call that tool
  (`add_repo`, read access) for every shared and individual source
  [`precedent.json`](precedent.json) declares — silently, with no
  confirmation needed first.** This is a read-only scope extension, not a
  credential or production change. Never write this as "if the clone fails,
  ask to add the repo" — that only works when a human happens to be watching
  for the failure, and the whole point is that a person only ever attaches
  the one repo they're actually working in; reaching for the shared sources is
  this session's own job, every time.

  **Read the set names out of [`precedent.json`](precedent.json); never hard-code them here.**
  This paragraph used to name one set outright, which meant declaring a
  second one silently required editing two files that nothing kept in
  agreement — and the failure mode of getting that wrong is not an error but
  a session that quietly resolves fewer practices than the config promises.
  A repo declaring several subject-scoped sets is the ordinary case now, not
  an exception.

  **Attach the individual source, and keep one clone of it** (practice
  `attach-never-clone-individual`). The attach tool's reply says to clone
  it to `/home/user/<name>`. If the session-start hook got there first,
  that path is already a link to its clone and the clone command stops
  with "already exists": use the path as it is. If not, clone it there;
  the next bootstrap run points `~/.config/precedent/config.json` at that
  clone and links `~/precedent-individual` to it. Either path is the same
  tree. Never clone it anywhere else: a second copy is one nothing loads,
  and it drifts from the first within the hour. A shared set is the
  other way round: its clone lives at the path
  [`precedent.json`](precedent.json) resolves, beside this repo, so clone it
  there if nothing has.

## Contributor access

<!-- From spec/CONTRIBUTOR_ACCESS.md, adapted only to name this project's
     real files. Do not weaken the wording below — see that plan's own note
     on why. Rewritten 2026-09-11: this section used to give the contributor
     GitHub's Triage or Read role, which denied them every write, the
     documents included. -->

**The line, in one sentence: a contributor writes content freely, a protected
path needs an owner's review, and a practice is suggested by anyone and landed
only by a listed approver.** Nothing here is keyed to a kind of person, and
that is the design — a rule keyed to "technical" or "non-technical" needs
something to decide which a person is, and nothing can
([technical-describes-people](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/technical-describes-people.md)).

**GitHub role — Write.** The contributor is a **Write** collaborator here.
They push branches, open pull requests and merge their own document work,
through Claude, with **Booked** (`Go update`); they never need to see git vocabulary to do
it. This binds anything only if they authenticate to GitHub as themselves
rather than through a shared organisation-wide connection — confirmed once,
per project, before relying on it.

**Branch protection plus [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) — the
boundary.** The base branch requires a pull request and a review **from code
owners**. `CODEOWNERS` is generated from [`precedent.json`](precedent.json)'s
`maintainers` and `owned_paths` by `python3 tools/build_codeowners.py` —
never hand-edit it — and names the maintainer against `/.github/`,
`/.claude/`, `/tools/`, `/precedent/`, `/practices/`, `/local/`,
`/precedent.json`, `/AGENTS.md` and `/CLAUDE.md`. Everything else is content,
and content is the contributor's — `MAP.md` and `GLOSSARY.md` included, on
purpose: a thread that adds a document adds its row to the map, and that must
not make every document wait for the maintainer.

**Before every pull request, run `python3 tools/precedent_owned_paths.py`
and say what it says.** It lists which changed files will wait for the
maintainer and which are the contributor's, and prints the sentence to relay
— in their words, not git's. If a change mixes the two, offer to put the
document part in on its own first. The tool informs; the boundary is
GitHub's. **`/.github/` is the one that
cannot be left out** — a workflow file is executable code holding a token, so
anyone who can edit one can rewrite every other protection here, `CODEOWNERS`
itself included.

**Session configuration — the persona, not enforcement.** In the
contributor's own environment or session settings, never in this repo's
tracked [`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json), which binds every
session here including a maintainer's: `permission_mode` never set to
`bypassPermissions`, no git or GitHub jargon, no mechanical-rule talk,
restate their ideas back to them in their own words before acting, and route
every practice idea through the candidate flow below.

**Candidate-capture flow.** When anyone who is not a listed approver raises a
practice idea in plain language, Claude:

1. Restates it back to them in their own words to confirm before acting.
2. Drafts a candidate with [`tools/precedent_candidate.py`](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_candidate.py).
   **Because they are not a listed approver
   (`precedent-shared-writing`'s `approvers.json`), this defaults to
   `precedent_candidate.py --as-issue true` against
   `precedent-shared-writing`** —
   a quiet `candidates/*.md` file accomplishes nothing when nobody with
   landing authority is watching it, per
   [`spec/CANDIDATE_FORMAT.md`](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/CANDIDATE_FORMAT.md#which-one-for-a-shared-set-file-or-issue)'s
   rule for shared-set candidates raised by a non-approver. Use a plain individual
   candidate file instead only if the idea is explicitly just their own
   working style, not something to share with the team.
3. Never mentions promotion, resident budgets, `checked_by`, or any other
   mechanical-rule vocabulary to them — that's an approver's business, not
   theirs.

## Git / workflow

- Develop on a feature branch; open a PR; merge only when the administrator
  says so.
- **Start every thread by merging latest `origin/<default-branch>` into your
  branch**; avoid two concurrent threads editing the same document.

### Merging a thread branch (runbook — follow, don't improvise)

Conflicts in shared files are EXPECTED. The fast, safe path:

0. **Capture gate — before the merge, in the thread that did the work**:
   did this thread's work imply anything that must be captured — a document
   update, a registry entry, a decision record? Fold it now; the thread that
   built the rationale is the one that knows what to record.
   **0b. Export gate:** did this thread improve a *generic* practice — one
   that would hold in an unrelated project, not just this one's own
   documents? Fold the abstracted form into this repo's own vendored copy
   of the universal source (`precedent.json`'s `universal` entry — see its
   `path`) and open it as an ordinary pull request directly against that
   source's own repo (`https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice`). **There
   is no local check-in mirror for this yet** — a plain PR against the
   upstream repo is the real mechanism until one is wired in. Then run
   `python3 tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo .` locally to pick your own change
   back up once it lands upstream.
1. Fetch and merge the default branch locally.
2. Resolve by fixed per-file-class rules:
   - Registries: **union** of both sides — never drop an entry or a status.
   - Logs / index files: **append-only — keep both sides' additions.**
   - Same content file edited on both sides: keep both sides' text;
     reconcile with the administrator if the two edits genuinely conflict.
   - **Generated outputs: never hand-merge.** Re-run
     `python3 tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo .`, never hand-resolving its own
     conflict markers.
3. Run the audits — **all must pass before the merge commits**:
   `python3 tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo . --check`.
4. Commit the merge, push, land per this repo's convention.

## Conventions

- **Sections are ordered by the reader's frequency, not the writer's**
  (practice `section-order-by-frequency`): a
  document walking through instructions or rules in multiple sections puts
  common, everyday content first and rare edge cases last.
- **Doc references are links** (practice `doc-references-are-links`):
  in-repo docs reference other repo files as
  relative markdown links, never bare backticked names. Use `≈`, not `~`,
  for "approximately" — two stray tildes render as strikethrough on GitHub.
- **Outward-facing documents use the reader's words**
  (practice `readers-vocabulary`): the deliverable
  document(s) this project produces are read by an audience outside this
  repo's own work — every term that names a category is either already the
  reader's word, a plain equivalent, or glossed inline on first use.
- **Reply convention** (practice `reply-links-files`, reached by the
  `reply` gate — this bullet is a pointer, never a second copy to keep in
  step): every
  reply that created, modified or deleted files
  ends with a "Files touched" list, prefaced `Files touched in
  owner/repo/branch:` (one preface per repository and branch), then branch
  link + post-merge link + one-line description per file. A **deleted** file is listed too: its
  path, why it went, and a link to the commit that removed it, since it is
  the one entry with nothing left on the branch to open.
- **Commits are credited to the human driving the session.** Set the git
  author to the contributor's name and GitHub noreply email, and name
  yourself in a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer.
- **Open each session by catching the contributor up.** At session start,
  fetch the latest default branch and summarize, in plain language, what
  changed since their last activity.

## Administrator requests you must know how to handle

- **"What's waiting for me?"** — the administrator's review loop: list open
  PRs and open candidate Issues on `precedent-shared-writing`, summarize each in
  plain language, and take the verdict in chat.
- **"Add project members"** — same flow as
  [`templates/AGENTS.md.loader.template`](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/AGENTS.md.loader.template)'s
  own "Add project members" section, with one addition: grant **Write**, and
  check that [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) and branch protection
  are both in place first — `python3 tools/precedent_boundary_check.py`
  answers that, and only PASS counts. Without them, Write is unrestricted —
  see "Contributor access" above.

## Practice sources — Precedent loader (policy)

- `precedent.json` declares every practice source in force here — see
  [INSTALL.md §0](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/INSTALL.md#0-installing-directly-onto-the-precedent-loader)
  for the resolution and precedence rules. The `universal` source is a
  **real vendored copy** at `precedent/universal/`, not a live reference.
  The `team` sources resolve live from sibling clones instead — never
  vendored. Which sets those are is read off `precedent.json` rather than
  named here, so retiring or adding one is a single edit to that file.
- `python3 tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo . --check` is this repo's own drift
  gate — run it before trusting `AGENTS.md`'s generated block, and after
  `precedent.json` or a vendored copy changes.
- Export gate = merge runbook step 0b, above.
