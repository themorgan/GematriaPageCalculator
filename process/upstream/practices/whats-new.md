## Rule
**"What's new?" has two halves, in this order.**

**1. Bring the log up to date.** Run
`python3 tools/precedent_whats_new.py --days`. For each finished day it
lists that has no entry, say first how many you are about to write
(*"writing the 2 missing days first"*), then write **one entry per day**,
newest first, at the top of the log, and run
`python3 tools/precedent_whats_new.py --mark <the latest of those days>`.
A day already covered is never written twice, so a second "What's new?" the
same day skips straight to half 2. Commit the log like any other change.

**2. Show it.** Link the log (*"check here daily"*). Show the newest entries,
then what changed today so far (`--today`), which no entry covers yet. Then
ask what they want to know more about.

**The log is a running record of everything interesting the project did**,
not a digest since someone's last visit. An entry picks **the day's most
noteworthy changes**, whether code, plumbing or content. A new guide or a
new philosophy document can be the day's news without a commit message
saying so, and `--days` lists each day's new documents for that reason.

**An entry's shape:** a headline sentence, then about three bullets. Each
bullet says the change plainly first, then the technical version in
parentheses, with a real figure or a real technical name: *"The
instructions every session reads first got much shorter (the opening of
AGENTS.md went from about 3,460 tokens to about 980)."* Lead with what
changed in how the project works, not with command words.
**Approximate is fine** ("about 800 tokens per session"): the figure has to
be real, not exact ([no-invented-specifics](no-invented-specifics.md)).
**Never name who approved or signed off on anything**;
`python3 tools/precedent_whats_new.py --check` flags an entry that does.

## Detail
**Where the log lives.** `WHATS_NEW.md` at the root (the tool: [tools/precedent_whats_new.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_whats_new.py)), or wherever
`precedent.json`'s `whats_new_path` points. Its one piece of state is its
front matter, `checked_through: <date>`: the last day it covers. That also
answers whether today's run already happened, since "checked through
yesterday" means it did. The tool reads the later of this checkout's log
and `main`'s, so a session working from a checkout that is behind doesn't
write days `main` already has.

**What counts as a day.** A calendar day in the repository's timezone
(`fallback_timezone` in `precedent.json`), never the writer's own: the log
is shared, so a day has to end at the same moment whoever writes it. A day
counts when `main` changed during it. Days with no change are skipped, and
so is a commit that touches only the log, or the log reaching `main`
would be news every day. The first run, with no log yet, covers the last
seven finished days.

**It runs newest first**, the one kind of dated list that does: a reader
opens a news log for the latest
([dated-list-runs-forward](dated-list-runs-forward.md) names this
exception).

**Fixing an entry is an ordinary edit.**

## Why
A shared project changes between a member's conversations, and nothing
brings those changes into their old chats. A summary made up at each
session start was different every time and left nothing behind. A log
written once a day, in plain words with the real figure beside them, is
something a member can check daily, link to, and trust.

## Story
Designed 2026-09-30 in a brainstorm session, critiqued in another. The
entry shape went through two review rounds. The critique found that the
log would have logged its own commits, that a tiered repo's `main` holds
only Promote merges (so the listing reads the commits they brought), and
that a person's own timezone would move a shared day's edges. It replaced
the templates' "catch the member up at session start" paragraph, which
summarized afresh each time and kept nothing.

## Install
Nothing to do: the tool ships with the engine, and the first "What's new?"
creates the log.
