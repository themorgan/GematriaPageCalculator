applies_to_why: "A rename can strand a reference in any file of any type -- a markdown link, a path inside a script, a workflow, a config -- so no narrower glob is honest. `**` is right here for the same reason it is right for no-version-suffix: the occasion is an action taken ON a file, not a property of the file being edited. Its check is scoped instead: it compares against the published default branch, so it only ever asks about renames this branch itself made. Decided: 2026-09-06, when the practice was added."

## Rule
Renaming, moving or deleting a file is only half the change. Every
reference to its old path — a markdown link, an image, a path in a script,
a workflow, a config — is repointed **in the same commit**, so the
repository is never in a state where the rename has landed and the links
have not. Search the whole tracked tree for the old path, not just the
directory the file lived in.

**A name is renamed the same way.** When a product, an organisation, a
term or a code is renamed or retired, every place that still uses the old
name to mean the thing is updated in the same commit, and the search is
for the name as well as for any path spelled with it. A use that quotes or
records the past — a dated decision, a filed or sent document, a
changelog entry — keeps the old name on purpose and is left as it stands;
everything else follows the new one. The check already leaves alone a
generated view, a closed todo item and a `## Story` section; declare any
other whole record file (a migration record, a dated audit) in
`precedent.json`'s `record_paths`, each with its `reason`.

**A migration off an old system retires a whole vocabulary, in the same
migration, unasked.** Every day-to-day document — instructions file,
glossary, map, onboarding page, workflow comments — loses the old system's
names, retired workflows and dead concepts before the migration is called
done, not when someone notices and asks. The old vocabulary survives only in
the migration record and genuinely historical logs, declared once in
`process/retired_vocabulary.json`;
[migration-scrubs-vocabulary](migration-scrubs-vocabulary.md) has that
file's format and the check for a leftover pre-migration pack.

## Why
A rename is the one edit that breaks files it never touches. The moved
file is fine, its own links are fine, and the damage lands in documents
the person renaming it did not open — so nothing they look at afterwards
looks wrong. Split across two commits, the repository is broken at every
commit in between, and anyone reading it there finds dead references with
no clue that a rename is what did it.

Splitting it also loses the only cheap moment to fix it: at rename time
the old path is known exactly, and one search finds every reference. A
week later the same job means guessing what the file used to be called.

A retired name does the same damage more quietly. No link breaks, so no
check fails; the old name goes on appearing in prose, in headings and in
generated text, and a reader who meets it cannot tell whether it is a
different thing or the same thing under its old name. The fix is the same
search at the same moment, run on the name.

## Story
Not a hypothetical here. A 2026-09-06 sweep of this repository found 96
markdown links resolving to nothing, and a second pass found nine more
pointing at headings that had been reworded since — a class where the
link still loads the right document, just at the top, so no reader ever
reports it. In a consuming repo the same sweep found eighteen links into
a directory that had been retired months earlier, still sitting in its
`TODO.md`. In every case the move itself was correct and complete; only
the references were left behind, and each one had gone unnoticed for as
long as it existed.

2026-09-07, the other direction: a private consumer repo renamed its content
directory, and of the check's eight findings, seven sat in files that repo
could not edit at all — an individual source's practice text, its check
script and that check's test, and the copy of its index clause inside the
generated loader block. Each of those uses the old directory name as the
canonical *example* of a convention; none points at anything in the
consuming repo, and `doc_lint` confirmed no link anywhere actually landed
nowhere. `practices/` and `tools/checks/` are `precedent_materialize.py`'s
own output directories — deleted and rewritten from every declared source on
every sync — so an edit there survives until the next sync and no longer.
The check now skips what a repo *received* rather than wrote, attributed by
`MANIFEST.json`'s own committed record rather than by live resolution, and
skips the generated loader block as a *region* so the hand-written half of
the same document is still checked. A check whose findings a repo cannot act
on trains people to ignore it, which costs more than the findings were
worth.

2026-09-28: a consuming repository retired a name and asked whether this
rule covered the leftovers. It covered the files and paths spelled with
the name, and not the prose that still used it, which is what a reader
actually meets; the rule now names the name as well as the path.

2026-10-01: migration-scrubs-vocabulary's index line folded in here, in the
reduction pass Morgan approved that day ("Question 3 - all are great,
approved", strength: decided). A migration is this rule applied to a whole
vocabulary at once, so its trigger and its core now sit in this Rule's last
paragraph. migration-scrubs-vocabulary stays in force for its declaration
format and its leftover-pack check, routed by the files a migration touches.

## Install
`tools/precedent_check.py`'s `rename-updates-links` check compares the
current branch against the published default branch, finds files git
records as renamed or deleted, and fails if any tracked file still
references an old path. It scopes to the branch's own changes on purpose:
a reference to a path deleted long ago is somebody else's history, and
this rule is about the rename you are making now.

`tools/doc_lint.py` covers the neighbouring case continuously — a
markdown link whose target does not exist, whatever caused it — including
`#fragment`s that no heading matches any more.
