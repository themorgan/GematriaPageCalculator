## Rule
A top-level `MAP.md` indexes the repo: what the key deliverables
are, where everything lives, and — crucially — which supporting documents back
each part of each deliverable. Every session reads it before doing anything.

## Detail

## Why
Without a map, every session greps. With one, orientation is one
file read, and "which documents back this section of the deliverable?" has a
committed answer instead of a fresh investigation.

## Story
No dated incident was recorded. The rule is a straight cost comparison, and
it is short because the comparison is not close.

**Without a map, every session greps.** That cost is paid once per session,
forever, by every person and every agent, and it is invisible because it
looks like ordinary work rather than like waste.

With a map, orientation is a single file read, and the harder question --
which supporting documents actually back this part of the deliverable -- has
a committed answer instead of a fresh investigation each time. That second
half is the part a bare directory listing cannot supply, which is why the
rule names it as the crucial one rather than settling for "where things
are".

**On-demand from 2026-10-01.** The reduction pass for precedent-individual's session-start file ([the session-file open item](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-30-session-file-cut-to-4000.md)) found this rule resident in every session while the install template already opens each instructions file with "read `MAP.md` first" and the orientation-map check refuses one that never names it. Morgan approved making it on-demand, reached by editing `MAP.md` or the instructions file (strength: decided): *"Booked, attach both shared sets, and do both Tier 2 items (and note as a possibility for the future in a Todo the other tier 2 items to consider)"*

## Install
[templates/MAP.md.template](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/MAP.md.template). Keep the
deliverable→backing-docs index current: any thread that adds a document adds
its row.
