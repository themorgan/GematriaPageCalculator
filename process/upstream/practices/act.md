## Rule
**Act is step 2 of the five-stage ladder ([promote](promote.md)): make the
change.** The work lives on this session's own **feature branch** -- the
short-lived branch named like `claude/<topic>-<random>` -- and is **pushed
there**, so a reclaimed container loses nothing. It is not shared yet:
nothing reaches pre-staging until [Booked](go-update.md).

**Act comes after [Consider](consider.md)**, even if the plan is one line.
A request to build with no plan yet gets the one-line plan first, in the
same reply.

**A feature branch is easy to forget**, which is why Act never ends a
session on its own. Work that reached Act but not Booked is said plainly
at the end of the reply, with Booked recommended
([the-boildown](the-boildown.md)).

## Why
Building straight onto a shared branch skips the checks and the chance to
change course; building only in the container loses the work when the
session ends. The feature branch is the one place that is both private and
safe.

## Story
Named 2026-09-27. Morgan first wrote "local clone" for this stage, then
corrected it: he meant the session's feature branch on GitHub, and Booked
is the step that moves it somewhere it will not be forgotten.

## Install
Nothing to install. The reply gate already says when a feature branch holds
work that has not landed.
