## Rule
When a message says **"Archive"** -- standing alone, case-insensitive, as its own line or as the whole of a sentence -- treat it as authorization to archive the session it means, **right then, in that same turn: no confirmation, no recap first.**

**Which session it means, unless one is named: the session the message arrived in.** End that session's lifecycle through whatever mechanism this harness provides, and check first whether anything is bound to fire into it later, so the person hears about it rather than finding it silently stopped.

**In Claude Code Remote, concretely**: resolve its own ID (`get_session` with no argument), check `list_triggers` for a Routine bound to it via `persistent_session_id`, and archive it (`archive_session`). A bound Routine does not block this -- the word is the authorization -- but say so in the reply, since an archived session accepts no events and the Routine will stop firing. **This is the only binding this practice currently has.** A session on a provider with no equivalent tool call has no way to carry out the mechanical half of this rule -- say so plainly, rather than silently doing nothing or guessing at a substitute, the same way [session-text](session-text.md) names its own dependencies rather than papering over them.

**Say plainly what happened and that it undoes.** State that the session is now archived -- read-only, its container released -- and that `unarchive_session` reverses it if it wasn't meant, with the one exception [the-boildown](the-boildown.md) already names: anything uncommitted, or committed but unpushed, in that container's working tree does not come back, because unarchiving provisions a fresh container rather than resuming the old one.

## Detail
**The word has to stand alone, the same test [go-update](go-update.md) already applies.** "That's it, thanks. Archive." and a lone line reading `ARCHIVE` both count. "let's go dig through the archive" or "can you archive that file" don't -- there the word is doing ordinary work inside a longer sentence, not standing alone as the message's last (or only) one. Where it's genuinely ambiguous which reading is meant, don't assume: ask.

**This is a different occasion from [the-boildown](the-boildown.md)'s own archive line.** That one is a *recommendation* a session makes on its own judgment, gated by three conditions (work safe elsewhere, nothing left to do, no bound Routine) before it ever suggests archiving. This one is the reverse direction: the person says the word, and the three conditions don't gate it -- a bound Routine gets flagged, not enforced, because the word is the person overriding the judgment call, not asking for it.

## Why
The standing-phrase mechanism already exists for exactly this shape of thing -- [go-update](go-update.md), [park-it](park-it.md), [weak-yes](weak-yes.md) -- so a one-word trigger for archiving is the same mechanism, not a new one. Encoding it as a command rather than leaving it to plain conversation is what makes it reach a session that has never talked to the person before but has this set loaded -- the same argument `go-update`'s own Story already makes about definitions sitting where a session can't read them.

## Story
**Deduplicated 2026-09-19, folded into `archive-status-check`.**
Morgan: *"Note that 'Archive' and 'Archive?' are the same thing. Even with
no question mark, you should first check to see what's outstanding and if
there is anything, tell me to make sure I want to archive it."* (strength:
decided). The "no confirmation, no recap first" reading the Rule above
describes is retired -- the bare word now runs the same three-condition
check `archive-status-check` already ran for the question-mark spelling,
before acting. The Rule and Detail above are kept as the record of what
the word used to authorize on its own; [archive-status-check](archive-status-check.md)
is where the current behavior lives.

Coined 2026-09-16 in Morgan's individual set, the same day he asked whether archiving a session works only through the UI or also through a command and, told it works as a direct tool call already, asked for "archive" itself as a standing word.

Moved to universal the same day, on his decision that it belongs alongside the project's other commands rather than staying his own habit: *"I think this should be a universal command not just for me."*

**Amended 2026-09-17**, closing the last named gap in
[spec/PROVIDER_PORTABILITY_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/PROVIDER_PORTABILITY_PLAN.md)'s
Phase 4: this practice was still naming Claude Code Remote's tool calls as
if any provider could make them. Unlike [session-text](session-text.md)'s
waking mechanism, there is no provider-neutral substitute to fall back
to -- ending a session's lifecycle is inherently a platform action, not
something a paste block can stand in for -- so the fix here is naming the
dependency rather than removing it.

## Install
No mechanical check, same class as [go-update](go-update.md): this governs how a message gets read, not a property of a diff or the repo tree, and the one place the distinction between "recognized the word" and "archived on its own initiative" is visible is the conversation transcript, which a repo-scoped script can't read.
