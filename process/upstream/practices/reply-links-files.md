## Rule
A session's reply that created, modified or deleted files ends with a
"Files touched" list: each entry links the file on the working branch *and*
its post-merge location, with a one-line description. The reader must be able
to open the work from the chat, not merely learn it exists. **A deleted file
is listed too** — its path, why it went, and a link to the commit that
removed it. It is the one entry with nothing to open on the branch, which is
exactly why a reader will not find it on their own.

**The list opens with where the files are: `Files touched in
owner/repo/branch:`** -- for example *Files touched in
alex137/BestPractice/pre-staging:* -- and the entries follow. A reply that
touched more than one repository or branch gives each its own preface and
its own list, so every entry sits under the place it lives.

## Detail
**A deletion is linked at the commit that made it**, not on the branch: a
branch link to a path that no longer exists is a 404, and the reader wants
the diff anyway — the removing commit shows what went, in full, and keeps
the content one click away for as long as the history exists. A whole
decommissioned directory is **one entry**, named as the directory with a file
count, never one line per file; the point is that the reader can see what
left, not that they can count it. Where the deletion is a retirement
([decommission-deletes-files](decommission-deletes-files.md)), the reason the
audit was given is the reason this entry states — write it once and use it
in both places.

**Rendered files get a rendered-view link, not just a repo link.** A
repository link to an HTML file or an image shows source or a raw blob — the
one form of the file the reader did *not* want. When the session's surface
offers hosted private previews (an artifact/paste service the harness
provides), a touched HTML render or picture's entry also carries that
rendered-view link, published from the same file path each time so the link
stays stable across revisions — one preview per file, re-published on
meaningful change, never a new one per reply. Files that are per-recipient
send records are excluded: a hosted preview is a distribution channel, and
those files' distribution is governed by their own send policy.

## Why
A reply that names the files it changed tells the reader that work happened. A reply that links them lets the reader open the work. The difference is one search per file per reply, paid by the reader every time -- and paid by the person with the least context, since the writer already has every path in hand.

Both links are required because each goes dead at a different, predictable moment. The working-branch link is the one that resolves now, while the reviewer is looking at the branch; the post-merge link is the one that still resolves after the branch is deleted.

Deletions are listed for the opposite reason to everything else in the list: not because the reader cannot open them easily, but because they cannot find them at all. A created or modified file announces itself — it is in the tree, and anyone browsing the branch trips over it. A deleted one leaves nothing behind to trip over, so a reply that omits it has hidden the single change the reader is least able to reconstruct, and the one most likely to be the one they would have objected to.

## Story
**This practice had an empty `## Why` as well as an empty `## Story`** --
the only one in the catalogue with neither, which is how it stayed
unnoticed: nothing looks wrong about a short file. The reason is recorded
here rather than left blank in both places.

No dated incident was recorded. What the rule prevents is a small cost paid
constantly rather than a large one paid once. A reply that names the files
it changed tells the reader that work happened; a reply that links them lets
the reader open the work. The gap between those two is one search per file
per reply, paid by the reader, forever -- and the writer, who already has
every path in hand, is the one person for whom closing it is free.

**Both links are required for a reason.** The working-branch link is
readable now, while the branch still exists and the reviewer is looking at
it; the post-merge link is the one that still resolves in a year, after the
branch is deleted. Either alone goes dead at a predictable moment.

**Deletions were added 2026-09-07**, on Morgan's ask, the same day
[decommission-deletes-files](decommission-deletes-files.md) landed and made
deleting a routine act rather than a rare one. Before that the rule said
"created or modified", so a session that deleted a directory could satisfy
it completely and never mention the deletion — and the practice that had
just been written to make deletion normal would have made that omission
normal too.

**Demoted from `tier: resident` to `tier: on-demand` on 2026-09-21**, in the
same reduction pass that moved
[fence-block-for-paste](fence-block-for-paste.md). The cross-source resident
block measured 2,198 tokens against the 2,000-token cap
([todo-2026-09-21-resident-cap-was-measured-on-the-wrong-shape.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-21-resident-cap-was-measured-on-the-wrong-shape.md)),
and this practice's 124 tokens were being paid on every turn for text the
`reply` gate already delivers at the one moment it applies. Morgan chose it
from a costed menu, 2026-09-21: *"Do A and B and C - I like all"*. strength:
decided.

**What actually changed is the channel, not the reach.** The rule fires at
the end of a reply that touched files; `gates: ["reply"]` is that moment
exactly, and the `UserPromptSubmit` hook prints its clause before the reply
is written. On a harness with no prompt-submit hook -- Codex, Gemini CLI --
it now arrives through the standing instruction rather than automatically,
which was weighed and accepted.

**The preface names the place, 2026-09-26.** Morgan: *"Files touched then
have the username slash repo name slash branch and then the list."* Replies
that touched several repositories in one turn had shown a flat list, and a
reader could only tell which repo and branch an entry was on by reading its
link. The preface says it once, up front. The "in" between the words and the
path is the session's wording of his ask. Strength: decided.

Convention in
[templates/AGENTS.md.template](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/AGENTS.md.template).

**On-demand since 2026-09-21**, reached by the `reply` gate rather than by
residency; see `## Story`. The convention itself is unchanged.
