## Rule
**The practice.** A model earns trust through how it is built, not through whether
its answer looks reasonable. Two failure modes exploit the gap, and both are
invisible to the checks people usually run.

The tell is a headline number that survived several passes without anyone
re-deriving the *parts*. Ask what each term physically pays for, and whether
anything is charged twice or not at all: a shared budget spent by two consumers,
work computed over the wrong path length, an actor whose own cost was never
booked because the analysis was framed around the other actor.

**Two things fix it, and only the second is reliable:**

1. **Assert on the decomposition.** Write checks that each term is *present* and
   behaves correctly — this quantity must be non-zero whenever those two differ,
   that path must exceed this one, this cost must be zero below a threshold and
   rise past it. Checks on the total pass happily while the parts are wrong.
2. **Derive it a second time, independently, and keep that derivation.** Hand
   arithmetic where a closed form exists; a separately written integration where
   it does not. Cancelling errors are exactly the class that only a second,
   differently-structured derivation catches. Commit it as a harness rather than
   discarding it — the errors it catches recur, and a review that lives in
   someone's scratch directory protects nothing.

The tell is a negative conclusion stated without a sensitivity beside it. Before
writing that something cannot be done, vary the inputs that would relieve it and
report the boundary instead: the conclusion is nearly always *"blocked here,
available there,"* which is far more useful than a flat no.

**Never encode an impossibility as an assertion until you have done that.** A
check that asserts a negative locks the error in as an invariant and defends it
against the next person who suspects otherwise — converting a soft mistake into
a hard one, and putting the burden of proof on whoever is right.

## Detail

## Why
**(a) A plausible total can hide errors that cancel.** If one term is omitted and
another is over-counted, the sum can land in exactly the range you expected, and
every downstream figure will look sane. Re-running the model does not help: it
reproduces its own assumptions faithfully, including the wrong ones. Nor does
tightening the tolerance on the output — the output was never the problem.

**(b) A negative result is often a parameterisation, not a property.** A model
answers the question its constants encode. If the levers that would relieve a
constraint are hard-wired to baseline values, the model can only ever report the
blocked case — and prose then promotes one parameterisation into a law of
nature. *"X is impossible"* becomes the finding when the truth was *"X is
impossible with these particular settings."*

**(c) The rule runs in both directions.** A *favorable* lever gets the same
treatment: when an analysis identifies "the cheap relief," the lever is not
characterized until it is swept to saturation, reversal, or a change of
binding constraint, with its costs charged at each point. An analysis that
stops at the first comfortable value silently promotes that value into a
settled operating point — the inquiry was framed as a feasibility question
(*"does it close?"*), so *"it closes"* terminated it, and nobody returned to
ask the design question (*"where should it sit?"*). The tell on this side: a
tuning constant wearing a settled-sounding name — *doctrine*, *baseline*,
*standard* — with no recorded decision behind it. Such a constant is an
assumption in uniform: nobody re-opens it, because the name says someone
already decided, and nobody did.

## Story
No dated incident was recorded. The rule names two failure modes, and both
are written from the same observation: **they are invisible to the checks
people actually run.**

**(a) A plausible total can hide errors that cancel.** Omit one term,
over-count another, and the sum lands in exactly the range you expected --
after which every downstream figure looks sane. Re-running the model does
not help, because it reproduces its own assumptions faithfully, including
the wrong ones. Tightening the tolerance on the output does not help either;
the output was never the problem.

**(b) A negative result is often a parameterisation, not a property.** A
model answers the question its constants encode. If the levers that would
relieve a constraint are hard-wired to baseline values, the model can only
ever report the blocked case -- and prose then promotes one parameterisation
into a law of nature. *"X is impossible"* becomes the finding when the truth
was *"X is impossible with these particular settings."*

The tell follows from both: a headline number that survived several passes
without anyone re-deriving the parts. Trust comes from how a model is built,
not from whether its answer looks reasonable.

**The favorable side.** A geometry setting labeled as settled was
picked in passing — a physical floor times a round margin — while the thread's
attention was on a pass/fail verdict. It sat unexamined while carrying a
double-digit-percent improvement, and when a reader's question finally forced
the sweep, a same-day audit found a second identically-shaped constant on the
same governing constraint, un-swept and worth a comparable gain. Only the
unfavorable levers had ever been varied, because this practice's pressure
previously ran one way. Removing that whole class is
[constants-are-risk-inputs](constants-are-risk-inputs.md).

## Install
**Related:** [check-source-architecture](check-source-architecture.md) (an option you invented is not a baseline) is the same
family one level up — there the *framing* is unexamined rather than the terms.
