## Rule
A `Session: <url>` trailer on every commit -- for Claude Code, `https://claude.ai/code/session_<ID>`. `Claude-Session: <url>` is also accepted -- the key Claude Code Remote's own harness actually emits as of 2026-09, functionally the same trailer under a different name. For unattended automation with no chat session behind it, the workflow run's own URL stands in. If a tool has no shareable link at all, the trailer says so explicitly (`Session: none available (<tool>)`) rather than being silently omitted.

## Detail
A commit GitHub makes with its own buttons -- a merge, squash or revert button, an edit made on the website -- needs no trailer: no session wrote it, and there is nowhere to put one. A practice set may exempt more (reverts, for example); what it exempts applies only where that set is declared.

## Why
So a reviewer can tell "considered and skipped" from "forgotten" at a glance, and can trace a change back to the conversation that reasoned it through.

## Story
Migrated from RepoPersonalPreferences by the phase-3 private-set
migration. No incident was recorded, and none is invented here.

The one design detail with a stated reason is the explicit
no-link-available form. A trailer that is simply omitted when a tool has no
shareable session link is indistinguishable from one that was forgotten, so
the rule requires saying so in the trailer itself -- which lets a reviewer
tell "considered and skipped" from "forgotten" at a glance. The same
reasoning covers unattended automation, where the workflow run's own URL
stands in rather than the field going blank.

**Moved to the universal catalogue on 2026-09-28**, from the shared set for
repository maintenance, on Morgan's accepting a session's recommendation
that it applies to any repository and not only to maintaining practice
sets. The rule text is unchanged. Its mechanical check did not move with
it -- see Install for why.

## Install
**The mechanical check lives with a shared set, not here.** The shared set
for repository maintenance carries a tree-scope script that requires a
trailer line in one of the valid shapes, reading the raw commit object for
merge detection (a shallow clone's boundary commit loses its real parents
under `git log --format=%P`). Since 2026-09-29 it judges only the commits a
push carries -- those origin does not have yet -- so a repository adopting it
no longer has to exempt its existing history first: old commits are never
judged, and every new one is judged at the first push that carries it. It
checks presence only, never that the URL resolves to a real session --
which is exactly the "considered and skipped" versus "forgotten" distinction
the Why names.
