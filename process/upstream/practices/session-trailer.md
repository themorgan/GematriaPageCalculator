## Rule
A `Session: <url>` trailer on every commit -- for Claude Code, `https://claude.ai/code/session_<ID>`. `Claude-Session: <url>` is also accepted -- the key Claude Code Remote's own harness actually emits as of 2026-09, functionally the same trailer under a different name. For unattended automation with no chat session behind it, the workflow run's own URL stands in. If a tool has no shareable link at all, the trailer says so explicitly (`Session: none available (<tool>)`) rather than being silently omitted.

## Detail
A commit GitHub makes with its own buttons -- a merge, squash or revert button, an edit made on the website -- needs no trailer: no session wrote it, and there is nowhere to put one. A practice set may exempt more (reverts, for example); what it exempts applies only where that set is declared.

## Why
So a reviewer can tell "considered and skipped" from "forgotten" at a glance, and can trace a change back to the conversation that reasoned it through.

## Story
Migrated from RepoPersonalPreferences by the phase-3 private-set
migration. No incident was recorded, and none is invented here.

The one design detail with a stated reason is the explicit
no-link-available form. A trailer that is simply omitted when a tool has no
shareable session link is indistinguishable from one that was forgotten, so
the rule requires saying so in the trailer itself -- which lets a reviewer
tell "considered and skipped" from "forgotten" at a glance. The same
reasoning covers unattended automation, where the workflow run's own URL
stands in rather than the field going blank.

**Moved to the universal catalogue on 2026-09-28**, from the shared set for
repository maintenance, on Morgan's accepting a session's recommendation
that it applies to any repository and not only to maintaining practice
sets. The rule text is unchanged. Its mechanical check did not move with
it -- see Install for why.

**Push gate, and off the occasion index, from 2026-10-01.** The reduction pass for precedent-individual's session-start file ([the session-file open item](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-30-session-file-cut-to-4000.md)) counted this among the lines a mechanical check already refuses at push: `check_session_trailer.py` runs in the push check wherever precedent-shared-repo-maintenance is declared. Where it is not, the push gate still prints this rule, after the commit exists; the Rule's own remedy is a reworded commit before it is shared. Morgan approved (strength: decided): *"Booked, attach both shared sets, and do both Tier 2 items (and note as a possibility for the future in a Todo the other tier 2 items to consider)"*

## Install
**The mechanical check lives with a shared set, not here.** The shared set
for repository maintenance carries a tree-scope script that requires a
trailer line in one of the valid shapes, reading the raw commit object for
merge detection (a shallow clone's boundary commit loses its real parents
under `git log --format=%P`). Since 2026-09-29 it judges only the commits a
push carries -- those origin does not have yet -- so a repository adopting it
no longer has to exempt its existing history first: old commits are never
judged, and every new one is judged at the first push that carries it. It
checks presence only, never that the URL resolves to a real session --
which is exactly the "considered and skipped" versus "forgotten" distinction
the Why names.
