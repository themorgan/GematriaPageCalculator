## Rule
A new file is named for what it *is*, with no `_v1` / `_rev2` label —
the repository already versions every line, so a version number baked into the
filename is redundant at best and misleading at worst (it goes stale the moment
the file is edited without a rename). A numeric suffix earns its place only when
two versions must **coexist** and a reader has to tell them apart (a successor
kept beside its predecessor for history); then it is the *new* file that is
suffixed, not the old one retro-renamed. An existing suffixed backlog is left
alone — bulk-renaming breaks the very references (links, records) the names are
load-bearing for; drop the suffix only from a file already being moved for
another reason, fixing its references in the same pass.

## Detail

## Why
"`_v1`" is the classic habit that duplicates the version control system
(VCS): it answers a question the version-control history already answers,
and unlike the history it does not
update itself — a `_v1` file edited fifty times still says `_v1`, so the label
actively lies. It also invites a rename on every real revision (churning the
references), or worse, a `_v2` copy that forks the file and splits its history.
Naming for identity instead keeps one stable handle per document and lets the
tool whose job is versioning do the versioning.

## Story
No dated incident was recorded; this is a named anti-pattern rather than one
repo's scar.

The specific charge against `_v1` is that **it does not merely duplicate the
version-control history, it eventually contradicts it.** A `_v1` file edited
fifty times still says `_v1`, so the label is not redundant any more -- it is
lying, and unlike the history it will never correct itself.

The second-order costs are what make it worth a rule rather than a
preference. Naming for version invites a rename on every real revision,
which churns every reference to the file; or, worse, it invites a `_v2`
copy, which forks the document and splits its history in two so neither half
tells the whole story.

Naming for identity keeps one stable handle per document and leaves
versioning to the tool whose job that is. The carve-out is narrow and
deliberate: a suffix earns its place only when two versions genuinely
coexist and a reader has to tell them apart.

## Install
A naming convention; no tooling needed. The one judgment call —
"do two versions genuinely need to coexist?" — is rare and deliberate, so it is
left to the author rather than a lint.
