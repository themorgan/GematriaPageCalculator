## Rule
**A practice file is published into every repository that adopts the
catalogue, so a relative link in one only works if the target travels with
it.** Four things do, the first three here: **another practice file in the same directory that is
still in force**, cited the normal way as a markdown link to its own
`<slug>.md`; **the vendored
engine files under `../tools/`** that every consumer receives; and **a
source's own check scripts and their tests under `../tools/checks/`**, which
materialization copies alongside the practices — the `check_*.py` scripts
and the `test_*.sh` files under `tests/` — a practice citing the script that
enforces it is the most common cross-reference a private set makes, and it is
a correct one. **A file a practice here declares in `ships:` travels too**
([practice-carries-its-files](practice-carries-its-files.md)): materialization
delivers it to the same path in every consumer, so `../tools/<script>` to a
shipped script is a correct relative link.

**A sibling that is no longer in force does not travel either**, and this is
the one shape that looks correct from inside the publishing repository. A
practice whose `status:` is anything but `active` is dropped by the resolver
before materialization, so the consumer receives the file doing the linking
and never the file being linked. **Link the successor instead** — `in_force_at:`
names it — or, where the rule was absorbed into the engine or is in force
nowhere, drop the link and say in prose what it covered.

**The one withdrawn sibling you may link is a DEDUPLICATED one whose
`in_force_at:` names its own slug**, and this is the common case in a private
set rather than an edge case. It means the copy *here* is redundant because
another source carries that same slug and is active. The resolver walks
sources lowest-precedence first, so the surviving copy lands at exactly the
`practices/<slug>.md` the link already points at, and the link travels
untouched. **Link it the normal way.**

**Everything else in the publishing repository does not travel** — `spec/`,
`templates/`, root documents, decisions, records, hooks. Link one of those
relatively and the link is live where it was written and dead in every
repository that receives it, which is the one place nobody checking it will
look.

**From a PUBLIC source, link it as an absolute URL** to the file in the
publishing repository, on that repository's declared `base_branch`. The
reader gets a live link wherever they are reading, and the writer gets to
keep the reference. **From a PRIVATE source, drop the link markup and keep
the backticked path** — an absolute URL would publish the private
repository's name into every consumer that materializes the practice, which
is a worse failure than a reference the reader has to go find. **Nothing downstream will
repair that one, and nothing downstream should** — `_rewrite_links` refuses
the private case on purpose, so the unlinked path is load-bearing rather than
an oversight somebody should tidy up later.

**A practice that lives in ANOTHER set is never linked by URL, whatever
this source's visibility** -- the public-source advice above is about files
in the publishing repository, and another set is not one. Write its slug in
backticks. The one exception is a universal practice, linked on the
universal source's declared `base_branch`. This is the shape a practice
moved between sets is left carrying: its sibling links now point at files
that stayed behind, and the obvious repair, a URL to where they stayed,
published a private set's name from a public one on 2026-09-23.

## Detail
**The public and private answers differ, and neither is the general case.**
What decides it is whether the target is readable by whoever ends up holding
the practice file. A universal practice published from a world-readable
upstream can name its own repository in a URL freely; an individual or shared
set cannot, and pays for the reference with a path the reader has to resolve
by hand.

**A sibling practice link is the one reference that survives in both
directions and at every level**, because materialization writes every
source's practices into one directory. Prefer it: a rule that can make its
point by citing another rule needs no URL at all. **It survives only while
the sibling is in force**, though — materialization writes the practices the
resolver resolved, and the resolver drops every non-active one — so the
sibling link is the safest reference in the file and the only one whose
target can stop travelling without anybody touching either file.

**The worst shape of this bug is not a dead link — it is a live one pointing
at the wrong file.** `../bootstrap/x` at least 404s, and a markdown lint can
see that. `../.claude/settings.json` **resolves** in the consumer, to that
consumer's own settings file rather than the one the sentence was written
about. No lint anywhere reports it; only reading the link as a claim about
*which repository* it assumes will catch it. The rule catches this one only
because `.claude/` does not travel — nothing would catch it if it did.

**Do not assume materialization repairs this for a public source.**
[precedent_materialize.py](../tools/precedent_materialize.py)'s
`_rewrite_links` does turn an unplaceable relative link into an absolute
URL when the source is public, which reads
like the problem solving itself. It does not, in the install that matters
most: when the universal source is a tracked tree *inside* the consuming
repository, the rewriter resolves the target within that repository instead,
finds nothing there, and leaves the link exactly as written — it will not
invent a target it cannot place. That is the right refusal and it is why the
links have to be correct in the publishing source.

**For a PRIVATE source it refuses on purpose, and the dead link is
load-bearing.** The same rewriter passes `may_name_source_repo=False` for
an individual source, so it leaves the relative link exactly as written
rather than minting an absolute URL into the publishing repository. That is
a privacy boundary, not a gap: the URL would hand a consuming repo's tracked
tree that private repository's owner and name, and a consuming repo can be
public. Its own words: *"a
relative link that does not resolve is a smaller failure than a disclosure
that cannot be taken back."* **So a session that finds such a link must not
make it absolute** — that is the disclosure, and it is the first thing
anyone tries. Nothing downstream repairs it and nothing downstream should;
the repair belongs in the publishing source, as a backticked path.

## Why
The catalogue is written in one repository and read in all of them, and
nothing about writing it makes that visible. A relative path resolves
correctly on the screen of whoever wrote it, passes that repository's own
link check because the file really is there, and breaks only after it has
been copied somewhere else — by which point the person holding the broken
link has no way to tell what it was ever pointing at.

## Story
**The rule is older than this file, and the private original had already
named four things this one missed.** It was written in `precedent-individual`
on 2026-09-06, out of the incident below. The universal text here was written
by a session that could not attach that repository and had never read it, so
it shipped without the check-script clause, without the shape that resolves
to the wrong file, without the private half of the materialization refusal,
and without the incident itself — and its check would have fired on a
correct link to a source's own check script. All four were closed on
2026-09-11, once the private sources resolved and the two texts could be
read against each other.

**The incident: 2026-09-06, three sessions, one day, one directory.** A
practice landed carrying three `../bootstrap/` links. The first push that
vendored it turned a consuming repo's Markdown lint red — three broken
relative links, a hard failure — and **the fix made them absolute, which
tripped that same repo's `private-repo-scrub`**, because an absolute URL was
precisely the disclosure the rewriter refuses to make. They were corrected to
bare backticked paths. Hours later two more practices landed with seven more
of the same, from a different session that had no way to know. A sweep then
found two in a third practice that had been dead **for weeks** and had never
been reported once — `doc_lint` scopes to CHANGED files, and nobody had
touched that file since. A gotchas note written after the first batch
prevented neither the second nor the third, which is the case for a check
rather than more prose
([checkable-gets-checked](checkable-gets-checked.md)).

**Measured 2026-09-11, in this repository at engine `89c90d7`: 134 relative
links across 42 of the 94 universal practice files pointed at 57 targets
that exist only here.** The same measurement taken from a real consuming
repository the same day reported 120 broken links across 40 of its 126
materialized practice files, against 52 distinct targets — the two counts
differ because a consumer's tree holds practices from other sources too, and
has root documents of its own that a few of the links happen to hit.

**The rule already existed and could not see the catalogue from anywhere.**
It was written in `precedent-individual`, with a real check script beside
it, and that script skips every practice whose source is not the individual
set — correct on its own terms, since a consumer cannot fix another source's
text and the next sync would overwrite the attempt, but it means the
universal catalogue was examined by nobody. In this repository neither the
practice nor the script existed at all: they live in a private set, and this
repository is not a materializing consumer, so they never arrived. Running
the consumer's own `precedent_check.py --only practice-links-travel` printed
**1 passed, 0 violated** while 120 links in the tree it had just scanned
were dead.

**The move to universal is [layered-practice-packs](layered-practice-packs.md)
applied literally**: this is a rule about how practice files are written, and
practice files are written here. The individual copy is still standing as of
this landing — that repository could not be reached from the session that
landed this one — and deduplicating it is
[spec/MOVING_PRACTICES.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/MOVING_PRACTICES.md)'s
second step, queued in
[TODO.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/TODO.md)
rather than done silently. The text here was written fresh rather than
carried across, for the same reason: nobody in that session could read the
original.

**The withdrawn-sibling shape, found 2026-09-14, after it bit the same
practice file twice.** An individual set's
`closing-items-are-this-thread.md` linked `half-the-words.md` from its Story;
`half-the-words` is `status: retired`, superseded by `reply-fits-one-screen`.
That set's own `precedent_check.py` reported **16 passed, 0 violated both with
the broken link and with it fixed** — the target file is sitting right there
in `practices/`, so nothing local is wrong and no local check could ever say
otherwise. It surfaced as a Markdown-lint failure in a repository consuming
that set, and only after that repo re-vendored and picked up the retirement —
which is to say the one repository that could see the defect was the one with
no way to fix it.

**The same file had already done it once**, and that set's `MAP.md` records
the first time: its first version linked `audience-register` as a sibling,
*"correct inside practices/, and broken the moment a consuming repository
materialized it."* Twice in one file with no check seeing either time is a gap
in the check rather than a slip in authoring
([mistakes-become-rules](mistakes-become-rules.md)) — and it is the same
lesson the 2026-09-06 incident above taught about prose: a note that a
previous session wrote prevented neither repeat
([checkable-gets-checked](checkable-gets-checked.md)).

**Why no check could see it, stated mechanically**, because this is the part
that makes the shape worth a rule rather than a reminder:
[precedent_resolve.py](../tools/precedent_resolve.py)'s `resolve()` skips any
practice whose status is not `active` before materialization is handed the
set, so a withdrawn practice is never written into a consumer's `practices/`.
Both halves of the link are correct in the publishing repository and exactly
one half arrives anywhere else. Every other shape this rule catches is
detectable where it is written; this one is detectable only by reading the
target's own frontmatter, which is what the check now does.

**The check's first run against a real private set was a false positive, and
it blocked the vendor update it was supposed to protect.** 2026-09-14, hours
after the clause above landed: a session taking this engine into an individual
set found two of that set's own practices linking `go-update.md`, which is
`status: deduplicated` there with `in_force_at: go-update` — **its own slug**.
The check read "not active" and reported both. The remedy it printed gave the
game away: *"that rule is in force as `go-merge` — link `go-merge.md`
instead"*, telling the reader to link the file they had already linked.

**A degenerate message is a symptom; the false positive was the defect.** The
session was one step from editing two correct files to satisfy a wrong check,
and it stopped because the remedy made no sense — which is a thin thing to
have relied on. Settled by measurement rather than argument: a fixture with a
universal `go-update` (active) and an individual `go-update` (deduplicated,
`in_force_at` itself) resolves to the universal one, so a consuming repository
does receive `practices/go-update.md` and the link was always sound.

**The miss, root-caused** ([mistakes-become-rules](mistakes-become-rules.md)):
the check asked "is this file in force?" when the question is "will a file
exist at this path in the consumer?" — and in a multi-source world those come
apart exactly where one source deduplicates against another. The check reads
one directory and cannot see the other sources, but it does not need to:
`in_force_at:` naming the file's own slug **is** the declaration that another
source carries it. What made this reachable at all is that the rule binds
publishers, so it runs in the sets where same-slug deduplication is normal —
and it was written against this repository, where every withdrawn practice
happens to point at a differently-named successor.

**The check itself had the "somebody else's repository" gap, found
2026-09-19.** Its URL branch only ever validated a link that named THIS
repository — any other absolute URL was treated as somebody else's to keep
working and skipped outright, no matter what it named. That included the
one target every repo declaring a source can actually check: the universal
source, cloned as a sibling before the first turn in exactly the repos this
check is vendored into. `precedent-individual/practices/my-identity-is-not-private.md`
linked `private-repo-scrub` as an absolute URL into BestPractice — the
practice had never lived there, only in a different declared source — and
the vendored copy of this exact check, run in that exact repository,
reported nothing: the self-slug guard skipped the link before ever asking
whether the path existed. Fixed by checking a non-self absolute URL against
the declared universal source's local clone (via `precedent_resolve.load_config`)
whenever that clone is resolvable, rather than skipping every non-self URL
unconditionally. Verified both directions against a scratch copy of
`precedent-individual`: the unpatched check reports the link clean, the
patched one reports it — the same real link, the same real repository,
nothing else changed.

**The check read a consumer's repo-local practices as published, found
2026-09-27.** A private consuming repository took a vendor update and its full
check reported 20 links in its own repo-local practices as dead — links to its
to-do list, its glossary and its instructions file, every one of which
resolved. The check kept every practice the committed manifest did not mark as
another source's, and a `repo-local` entry is not another source's, so the
materialized copies were tested as if every consumer received them. None does.
The printed repair made it worse: an absolute URL into that private repository,
which is the disclosure this rule's own text forbids for a private source. The
consuming session rewrote its links to satisfy the check
rather than wait. Fixed at the source: the check skips a practice whose
manifest entry is `repo-local`, and suggests a URL only in a repository that
declares itself public.

## Install
[tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py) enforces it, as a
tree-scope check over the practice files this repository owns. It reads
which engine files travel from
[tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)'s
`CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES` rather than keeping a second list, and it holds the
other half too: an absolute upstream URL must use the branch
`precedent.json` declares and must name a path that actually exists in the
tree. **For a sibling link it reads the target's own `status:`**, through
[build_views.py](../tools/build_views.py)'s `is_in_force` rather than a second
copy of the vocabulary, so it fails closed the same way the loader does: a
status this engine does not recognize counts as not in force. The finding
names the successor when `in_force_at:` gives one, because a finding that only
says the link is broken sends the reader back to the dead file to work out what
replaced it. **A sibling whose `in_force_at:` is its own slug is not reported
at all** — that is deduplication against another source, and the surviving copy
materializes at the same filename. **A withdrawn-sibling link between two withdrawn practices is
not reported** — neither file reaches a consumer, so nothing anybody receives
is broken. Only that finding is suppressed: the rest of the rule still applies
to a withdrawn practice's links, which are read in the publishing repository
whether or not they travel out of it.

**In a materializing consumer the check reports SKIPPED with its
reason** — `practices/` there is generated output, and the links have to be
right in the publishing source or not at all. **That includes the consumer's
own repo-local practices**, which the committed `MANIFEST.json` marks
`level: repo-local`: a repo-local source is never published, so a link from
one into the repository's own files is correct, and whether it resolves is
the Markdown lint's question. **The repair it suggests follows the
repository's declared `visibility`**: an absolute URL only when
`precedent.json` says `public`, and the backticked path otherwise.
