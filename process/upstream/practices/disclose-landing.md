## Rule
Whenever a session lands a practice or raises a candidate — at any of the
three levels — its reply states plainly, in its own words, that this
happened and exactly where: the individual's own set, a **named** shared set,
or the universal library. It also states plainly whether the practice is
already in force or is still waiting on someone else's yes, and if the
latter, who that is. This is never left to be inferred from a file path in a
diff, a tool's stdout, or a generic "I've added a practice" with no level or
location named.

**Say WHY that level, in one clause, and decide it rather than asking.**
[layered-practice-packs](layered-practice-packs.md) already gives the test —
*would this hold in an unrelated repo?* → universal; *only in another repo
running the same kind of program?* → shared; *only for one person?* →
individual; *only here?* → repo-local — and the session applies it and
proceeds. **Do not stop to ask which level.** The person reviews the choice
before the merge, which is the right moment for it: they can see the actual
text by then, and a wrong level is one file move away
([spec/MOVING_PRACTICES.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/MOVING_PRACTICES.md)), not a rewrite.

**A level stated without its reason cannot be disagreed with**, which is the
whole point of stating it. *"Universal, because nothing in it is specific to
this project"* can be argued with; *"landed in universal"* can only be
accepted. Morgan, 2026-09-08, describing what he wanted from this: *"you
should make a guess (based on the type of content, and the user's permission
levels), and TELL THE SESSION USER, and then do it."*

**Permissions are part of the guess, not an obstacle to it.** A practice
that belongs in a shared set the session cannot reach still gets named as
belonging there, with the reason it landed somewhere else instead — that is
a disclosure, not a failure. Recording it at the wrong level silently is the
failure.

## Detail
`precedent_land.py` and `precedent_candidate.py` both print an explicit
`DISCLOSE TO THE HUMAN:` line for exactly this reason — it names the level,
the location, the approver where one is needed, and whether the practice is
already in force. A session that runs either tool has this sentence handed
to it already assembled; the failure mode this practice exists to prevent is
reading that line and then summarizing the *outcome* ("added a practice
about X") while dropping the *level and status*, which is exactly the
information a person cannot recover without reading the diff themselves.

The three shapes this actually takes:
- **Individual** — always already in force the moment it's agreed; say so,
  and name whose set it's in (it's never ambiguous — it's the person you're
  talking to).
- **Shared** — in force immediately if the person is a listed approver (say
  which shared set, and that their own agreement was the approval);
  otherwise it is a proposal sitting where an approver will see it, and the
  reply names both the set and, if known, who has to say yes.
- **Universal** — never in force yet on landing; it is a draft that needs a
  pull request (PR) merged into this repository's landing branch
  (`pre-staging` or `staging`), gated by that branch's own check tier
  rather than a second reviewer
  ([merge-target-is-beta-branch](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md)).
  Say so explicitly rather than letting "landed" read as "done."

## Why
Asked directly whether this was happening — "do you clearly tell the human,
and clearly say where?" — the honest answer was no: the tools' own output
technically carried enough information to work it out, but nothing required
a session to actually relay it, and nothing stopped a summary that named the
practice without naming its level or status. That gap is exactly the kind
this catalogue exists to close: the design plan already said "the proposer
is told immediately what happens next... never leave the person who raised
it guessing" (PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, Stage 4), but that was narrative
intent, not an enforceable rule a session could be checked against. This
practice is that intent, made explicit and citable.

## Story
A session had built the individual/team/universal creation pipeline and
used it repeatedly across a working session, landing and proposing several
practices along the way. Asked afterward to confirm, plainly, that every one
of those had been disclosed to the human with its level and location named,
the honest answer was that this had never been made an explicit requirement
— it happened to come across clearly in that particular conversation, but
nothing in the tooling or the instructions actually guaranteed it would
happen again, on a different practice, in a different session. The fix
went into the tools themselves (`DISCLOSE TO THE HUMAN:` lines,
unconditionally printed) rather than trusting a session's own judgment to
remember, since a rule about what a *reply* contains cannot be verified by
scanning a repo's tree — only by the tool that generates the sentence in
the first place, every time it runs.

## Install
`tools/precedent_land.py` and `tools/precedent_candidate.py` print the
`DISCLOSE TO THE HUMAN:` line unconditionally in every code path that lands
a practice or raises a candidate — no separate install step; it ships with
the creation pipeline itself. `tools/verify_harness.py`'s
`check_creation_pipeline_fires` asserts the marker appears for every level.
