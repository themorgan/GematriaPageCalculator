"""precedent_ci_verified.py -- did CI actually run on the commit about to be
merged, and did it pass?

THE FAILURE THIS ANSWERS, 2026-09-23 in alex137/BestPractice. A pull request
showed a green tick. One workflow of the two had run on its head commit; the
other, the one carrying verify_harness/precedent_check/doc_sync, never fired
at all. Its `pull_request:` trigger had produced a run for the four previous
pull requests on that same branch and silently produced none for the fifth,
with no configuration difference. Nothing on the pull request page said so:
GitHub re-attaches a branch's historical workflow runs to whatever pull
request is currently open on it, so four green runs earned by EARLIER pull
requests on the same branch name were displayed as this one's history.

So "the pull request is green" is not the question. The question is whether
a successful run exists FOR THIS EXACT COMMIT, for every workflow that was
supposed to produce one. That is what this answers.

ADVISORY, NEVER A REFUSAL, and that is a deliberate limit rather than
timidity. It asks GitHub unauthenticated, which is 60 requests an hour per
IP shared across every session on this machine (practice:
github-api-budget). A gate that blocked a merge on somebody else's rate
limit, or on a proxy hiccup, would be routed around within a week and then
believed by nobody. It reports; the person or session decides.

ONE REQUEST per invocation: GET /repos/{slug}/actions/runs?head_sha={sha}.
The workflow-RUNS endpoint rather than the check-RUNS one deliberately --
check runs are named for JOBS ("verify_harness (everything else)"), which
cannot be matched against the workflow files on disk; workflow runs carry
the workflow's own `name:`, which can.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated because a checker that looks complete is worse
than one that says where it stops:
  - whether a workflow that did not run was SUPPOSED to, in any case
    subtler than its trigger block. The expected set is read from the
    workflow files and over-reports rather than under-reports: a workflow
    narrowed by `paths:` or by a glob branch pattern is expected here even
    where GitHub would skip it.
  - a private repository. Unauthenticated, GitHub answers 404 for private
    and for deleted alike, so that resolves to UNVERIFIED, never to clean.
  - whether the run tested what it claimed. A green run of a workflow whose
    job silently skipped its real work still reads as success here.

    Read off the tree rather than hardcoded, so adding a workflow is enough
    to make it expected and nothing has to remember to update a list
    (practice: registry-source-of-truth).

    A workflow counts when its `on:` declares `pull_request:` whose branch
    filter the pull request's `base` satisfies, or `push:` whose branch
    filter this branch satisfies -- an ABSENT filter meaning every branch,
    and an unknown `base` counting as a match (over-report, never miss).

    THE BASE WAS IGNORED until 2026-09-30: any `pull_request:` counted, so
    deep-check.yml (`pull_request: branches: [main]`) was expected on every
    pull request into pre-staging, where it never fires, and the merge gate
    said "CI DID NOT RUN" and advised a workflow_dispatch run that would
    have spent Actions minutes for nothing. Both shapes
    are live in this repository: deep-check.yml is pull_request plus push on
    main, leak-gate.yml is push on every branch and no
    pull_request at all.

    THE NAIVE VERSION WAS WRONG and its own output caught it: testing for
    the substring `pull_request:` anywhere in the `on:` block reported
    leak-gate.yml as pull-request-triggered, because that block carries a
    COMMENT explaining why the trigger was removed. Anchored to the start of
    a line, past indentation, a comment cannot pose as a key.

    Blind to `paths:`/`paths-ignore:` filters and to glob branch patterns; a
    workflow scoped by either is over-reported rather than missed, which is
    the safe direction for a thing that only ever advises."""
