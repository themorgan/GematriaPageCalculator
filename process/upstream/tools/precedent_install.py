"""precedent_install.py -- install Precedent into a project in one command.

Run from a clone of Precedent (this repository), pointed at the project:

  python3 tools/precedent_install.py <project path> --project-name "Recipe Book" \\
      [--about "one sentence, used only if the project has no README yet"] \\
      [--base-branch main] [--visibility private|public] \\
      [--output-paths docs,site] [--admin github-handle] \\
      [--team NAME=PATH ...] [--force]

It performs INSTALL.md section 0 -- the loader install -- mechanically: it
vendors the practice catalogue and the engine, writes precedent.json,
instantiates every template section 0 names with the placeholders this
tool can know filled in, runs the sync, lints the files it wrote, and then
prints exactly what it could NOT decide: the placeholders left for a person
or an assistant to adapt, and any wording that still names a layout this
project does not have. It never commits, never pushes, never asks.

WHY THIS EXISTS (practice: cite-the-incident). The 2026-09-14 very deep
check rehearsed section 0 as written and found that a correct install took
nine prose steps, a table of exceptions, and a grep, and still came back
with a red check and a template the adopter was told not to touch failing
the light check. Every one of those defects was a document describing a
sequence of file operations drifting from the operations. A tool that
performs the operations cannot drift from itself, and what it prints at the
end is the part that genuinely needs judgment. The guided install
(SETUP.md) runs this and adapts what it lists.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, on purpose. It does not fill in
local/practices/project-voice.md's or
local/practices/project-visual-identity.md's sections (an install
does the essentials and stops -- INSTALL.md, "Essentials only").
It does not wire a shared or individual source beyond what --team declares;
the shared/individual question is a conversation with the administrator
(INSTALL.md section 1 step 9). It does not commit: a person reviews the tree
first. And it does not run the freshness guard or any session hook -- those
run in the project's own sessions from then on.

IT INSTALLS TWO GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOWS BY DEFAULT, since 2026-09-25:
leak-gate.yml and light-check.yml -- one light check on a pull request into
main, and a leak gate that never runs in a private repository. An individual
or shared source whose identity.json declares `"github_ci_workflows":
"disabled"` switches both off (the old key `ci_workflows` is still read).
From 2026-09-15 to 2026-09-25 nothing declared meant disabled. The tool names
the reason in its output and in the project's own GETTING_STARTED.md. See
documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md.

Exit 0 when the install completed and the lint of the written files passed;
exit 1 when it refused (already installed, not a git repository) or a step
failed; the message says which.
