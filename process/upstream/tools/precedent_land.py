"""precedent_land.py — Stage 5 of PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md's creation
pipeline: write an approved candidate into the right repo's practices/ and
regenerate that repo's generated views.

Re-runs Stage 3's four criteria itself rather than trusting a prior
`precedent_promote.py` run — approval is a human act between promotion and
landing (Stage 4), and nothing should be able to skip straight to landing a
candidate that was never actually promoted.

THE ONE RULE STAGE 5 EXISTS TO ENFORCE ("What phase 5 should carry
forward," PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md): **a `checked_by` claim with no
registered, tested check is refused here, not merely warned about.**
"Registered" means different things per level, because the private repos
carry no `precedent_check.py` engine of their own
(spec/PRIVATE_ENFORCEMENT_BRIEF.md):

  universal          -> the slug must already be a key in
                         tools/precedent_check.py's CHECKS registry (which
                         the harness's check_precedent_check_fires already
                         guarantees carries a planted test case).
  individual / team  -> tools/checks/check_<name>.py must exist AND
                         tools/checks/tests/test_<name>.sh must exist AND
                         reference it by name — check_deep_check.py's own
                         invariant, replicated here rather than re-derived.

APPROVAL, per level (Stage 4, and this phase's own retirement-routing
amendment generalizes the same table to removal):
  individual -> --approved-by NAME is the owner's own "yes." Landed directly.
  team       -> --approved-by NAME must be a listed approver in that
                repo's approvers.json. Landed directly (the plan's own
                allowance: "for a small team ... the session commits it
                directly").
  universal  -> this tool DRAFTS practices/<slug>.md and STOPS. Stage 4's
                own answer for universal is "a PR to Precedent" — a human
                reviewing and merging a PR is the approval, and no tool
                should be able to grant that to itself. Commit the drafted
                file to a branch and open a PR.

--strength decided|assented records HOW FIRMLY the approval was given
(practice: decision-strength). Omit it and the field is left out, which
means unknown -- never `decided` by default, since a tool that assumed
enthusiasm would be manufacturing exactly the endorsement that practice
exists to stop.

Usage:
  precedent_land.py --file CANDIDATE.md --level individual|team
      --path REPO --approved-by NAME [--strength decided|assented]
      [--against PATH[,PATH...]]
  precedent_land.py --file CANDIDATE.md --level universal
      [--strength decided|assented] [--against PATH[,PATH...]]
