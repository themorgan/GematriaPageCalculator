Run it from a Precedent checkout: the sets and the consuming repositories
do not vendor it (the rehearsal of 2026-09-14 spent its first minutes
looking for a copy in the set), and every --from-path / --to-path is a
path to the set, absolute or relative to where you run it.

The two-step move spec/MOVING_PRACTICES.md describes, done in the one order
that is safe and with nothing left to remember:

  1. LAND the practice at the destination, as its own file, carrying the
     Rule, Detail, Why and Story exactly as they are -- this is vetted text,
     not a new draft -- with the destination level's own approval recorded
     (`--approved-by`; a listed approver for a shared set).
     One thing about the text does change: a link to a SIBLING practice
     that is not at the destination is re-homed -- a universal practice's
     URL, else the slug in backticks, never a URL into another set (see
     _rehome_sibling_links for the 2026-09-23 incident). Each is printed.
  2. DEDUPLICATE the copy at the source: `status: deduplicated`,
     `in_force_at: <the slug>`, and one dated line appended to its ## Story
     saying where it went and who approved it. Never a delete: the resolver
     drops a non-active practice before materialization, and the record of
     where the rule now lives is what a consumer's `precedent_show` reports.

Both sets' generated views are regenerated afterwards, where each set
carries build_views.py. Nothing is committed; the two sets are yours to
commit and publish, and a consumer picks the move up on its next sync.

  3. FIX THE MENTIONS, in every repository in force, on the run that
     withdraws the source copy (see _fix_mentions). A link to the old file
     is re-pointed where the practice now lives (the rules step 1 uses); a
     path naming the old set's copy names the new one; and a present-tense
     line that says where the practice lives names the new set. A dated or
     past-tense paragraph, a ## Story, a code comment's prose, and
     generated, vendored or record files are history and stay as written. Each file changed is
     named, and so is each repository -- commit every one of them.
     Morgan, 2026-09-28 (strength: decided): "I don't need a detailed
     report but for those problems to be solved."
     `--mentions-only` runs this step alone, for a move already made --
     it refuses unless the source copy is deduplicated and the destination
     copy active, so it can never rewrite mentions of a practice that has
     not actually left.
     Scope: this Precedent clone and every source its precedent.json and
     your user config resolve, plus both sets. PRECEDENT_MOVE_MENTION_REPOS
     (paths joined with the OS path separator; empty for none) replaces the
     discovered list -- the harness sets it so a fixture never reads real
     repositories.

WHY A TOOL (practice: cite-the-incident). The procedure said to run the
creation pipeline with the existing practice's text as the candidate's
content -- and precedent_candidate.py takes one `--proposed-rule` string,
so an existing file's four sections had no way in, and every move was a
hand copy with the deduplication done from memory or forgotten. Morgan,
2026-09-14: he had "had bumps doing that". The document itself named a
`precedent_move.py` that "does both atomically, and enforces the ordering"
as the missing piece; this is it.

WHAT IT REFUSES, each with its own message: a source practice that is not
`status: active`; an empty ## Story at the source with no `--story` to fill
it (a move is the last moment the original context is in front of
somebody, and catalogue-carries-stories would hold the destination red);
a destination that already carries the slug; a team destination whose
approvers.json does not list `--approved-by`; a `checked_by` naming a check
script the destination does not have (the script and its test move by hand
first -- see spec/PRIVATE_ENFORCEMENT_BRIEF.md); a `ships:` file the
destination does not have (same: copy it first, and commit it with the
practice); `--from universal --to
universal` (nothing to move); `--dedupe-only` on a practice that moved
OUT of universal, without `--accept-reach-loss` also given (see below), or
while the universal clone's tools/ still cite it as `practice: <slug>`;
withdrawing a practice from a shared set without `--approved-by` naming one
of THAT set's approvers (a removal changes what the team is bound by).
A `--to universal` draft from a file with no ## Install gets an empty one,
and says so: every universal practice carries the section.

UNIVERSAL AS THE DESTINATION drafts only: the file is written into the
Precedent clone's practices/ and the source is left ACTIVE, because the
landing there is still the pull request merging -- a session may merge it
directly once its deep check passes, same as any other PR into
precedent-beta-v01 (spec/MOVING_PRACTICES.md, merge-target-is-beta-branch.md)
-- and a source deduplicated before that lands has a rule in force nowhere. The
clone's own generated surfaces are regenerated (build_views.py, doc_sync.py
--write) so its deep check is green on the draft. Run this tool again with
`--dedupe-only` once the PR has merged AND every repository consuming the
source set has taken the new universal catalogue -- a consumer still
vendoring the old one sees the rule in neither source, and its sync prints
IN FORCE NOWHERE and drops it (exit 0) until it is refreshed (INSTALL.md
\u00a72 step 0, "Update Vendors").

UNIVERSAL AS THE SOURCE duplicates, never deduplicates, on landing.
`--from universal --to shared|individual` writes the destination copy
exactly as any other landing, but the universal copy stays `status: active`
-- it is NOT marked deduplicated, and `in_force_at` is not touched. This is
structural, not caution: universal is the one level every Precedent
consumer resolves, and a shared or individual set is not, so a universal
practice deduplicated to point at one leaves the rule genuinely in force
nowhere for any consumer that never declared that destination -- most of
them. [tools/precedent_sync_views.py](precedent_sync_views.py) reports an unresolvable `in_force_at` on
every sync (IN FORCE NOWHERE; exit 0 -- `precedent_resolve.py --strict`
fails on it), so that state alarms every plain consumer, not just a
reader. Confirmed by
incident, 2026-09-23: done by hand instead of by a tool, this exact move
passed every fast check and was only caught by \u2018verify_harness.py
--as-ci\u2019's consumer-fixture check hours later, after both copies had
already been pushed.

Both copies are then genuinely in force at once -- a deliberate, disclosed
duplication, not a bug -- and a Story note in each says so and points at
the other. Withdraw the universal copy later, on purpose, once the audience
that matters has taken the destination: run this tool again with
`--dedupe-only --accept-reach-loss`. `--accept-reach-loss` is required on
that run and that run only, is refused without it, and is not needed for
any other direction -- a plain universal-only consumer (most Precedent
adopters) loses the rule entirely the moment that step runs, and the flag
is the human decision that the audience who still needs it has moved.

Exit 0 on a completed move (or a completed draft); 1 on a refusal, with the
reason on stderr and nothing written.
