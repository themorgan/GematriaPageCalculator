"""precedent_update.py -- "Update Vendors" as one command: every step of
vendor-update-runbook that needs no judgment, in order, then one report.

Run it from the consuming repo, calling THIS copy -- the one in the
BestPractice clone, never a vendored one:

    python3 ../BestPractice/tools/precedent_update.py --repo .

WHY IT EXISTS (spec/ONE_COMMAND_UPDATE_PLAN.md, practice:
vendor-update-runbook). "Update Vendors" used to authorize a runbook that a
session then carried out by hand, and every consuming repo stopped at the
same places. The case that settled it, 2026-09-27: a consumer update stopped
halfway, engine on main and catalogue on precedent-beta-v01, because
finishing it meant a hand edit a permission check held for a human -- to
re-make a decision already made two days earlier. The rule this follows: an
upstream decision that changes a consumer's files is a step here, never a
sentence in the runbook.

WHY FROM THE SOURCE CLONE. A consumer's vendored checkin.py lives inside
the catalogue it updates, so a fix to it reaches a repo only after that repo
needed it. Run from the source clone, every step is the current code: the
engine refresh, the catalogue update (checkin.py --repo), the pin repoint.

THE STEPS, with no question in between:
  0. a journal an earlier run left when it was killed mid-swap is
     replayed, so this repo's local edits are back before anything reads
     the tree
  1. the source clone fetches the branch every install follows
  2. the engine refresh (the consumer's own copy, which replaces itself and
     runs a second pass), with each committed local edit to an engine file
     resolved around it by precedent_local_edits.py -- kept, merged, or
     replaced by upstream's with the commit holding it named -- then the catalogue-pin repoint and the renamed
     precedent-team-* -> precedent-shared-* sources from THIS copy; it
     stops if, with no --from-ref, the engine landed anywhere but the tip
     step 1 fetched, and leaves for you a run budget upstream gives a
     vendored tool that this repo's github_api_budgets.json lacks
  3. the catalogue: checkin.py update, then record, where the repo vendors
     one under process/ (process/manifest.json), its committed local
     changes resolved the same way; for a section 0 install,
     its universal source's practices/ replaced wholesale (INSTALL.md
     section 2, step 0) and the commit recorded in CATALOGUE_SYNC.json
     beside it; and where there is neither, a line saying so
     then a root VOICE.md or STYLEGUIDE.md left for you to convert, and
     any line templates/gitignore.template gained appended to .gitignore,
     and each line of an install-once file (the PR template, TODO.md, MAP.md
     ...) that is still, verbatim, wording its template has since dropped,
     left for you -- reported, never rewritten
     then, where precedent.json names no landing_branch, pre-staging
  4. the views regenerated -- the loader block, and in a practice set
     MAP.md and GLOSSARY.md too -- then manifest baselines moved for files
     now identical to upstream, a missing headroom_floor_pct defaulted,
     each file still naming one the refresh deleted left for you, and this
     repo's own citations of any practice the update withdrew or reworded
     (a withdrawn one's pointer is a call left for you; a bare mention of
     one, and a reworded one's citation, are listed to read)
  4a. any missing branch tier made on origin: staging from pre-staging,
     pre-staging from staging, both from main when neither exists
  5. the repo's own check at its landing branch's tier -- into pre-staging,
     the fast checks on what changed; the full check waits for the Promote
     (--skip-check to leave it out) -- run against a temporary commit of
     the staged update, undone right after, so it judges the tree the way
     the push will

THE REPORT, and the exit code a session acts on:
  0  DONE -- nothing is left. Commit, then run Go update's chain.
  1  LEFT FOR YOU -- only the calls that belong to this repo: an
     uncommitted edit to a received file, a kept-on-purpose file upstream
     has since changed, a line a check-in would lose, a decline to decide
     again. A committed local edit is no longer one of them: it is resolved,
     and listed under LOCAL EDITS in every outcome. Each is named with the question. Work them under the
     conflicted-file review at the top of vendor-update-runbook, then run
     this again.
  2  FAILED -- a step could not run, or the deep check is red. Named, with
     what was written before it stopped.

It stages what it wrote and deleted, so the deep check judges the tree the
commit will hold, and leaves anything already uncommitted alone -- save the
pinned engine a source refresh wrote ahead of it, which is the update's own
and is staged as such when every file matches the manifest. It never
leaves a commit behind, and never merges. The one thing it pushes is a
missing branch tier (pre-staging or staging), made at a commit origin
already has; the deep check's temporary commit is undone before it
reports. Those stay with the session, under Go update's
chain, where the authorization already lives.

    cannot edit -- was judged as this repo's own new prose; once committed,
    nothing is uncommitted and the push never judges it. And a shipped test
    that clones the repo clones HEAD, so it ran the update's NEW test
    against the OLD scripts. Both failed an update that passes the moment
    it is committed.

    So the staged update is committed, the check runs, and the commit is
    undone with `git reset --soft`, which moves only HEAD: the index and the
    working tree are left exactly as the check found them, staged work and
    unstaged edits alike. The commit goes through the repository's own
    hooks, the way the real one will, and carries the person's zone.
