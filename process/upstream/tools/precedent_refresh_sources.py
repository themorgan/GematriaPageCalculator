"""precedent_refresh_sources.py -- find the practice-set sources attached to
this session and tell whether their vendored engine is out of date; with
--apply, bring them up to date.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND THE INCIDENT THAT PRODUCED IT (practice:
cite-the-incident). A source set -- someone's own precedent-individual, a
team's precedent-team-* -- vendors this repo's engine as tracked files.
Nothing told anyone when that copy went stale. On 2026-09-06 two real sets
sat at ef8b5d09 while this branch moved more than two hundred commits past
it, and both were generating a loader block with a defect fixed upstream
days earlier (a standing instruction advertising four gate commands, all
four of which failed there). It surfaced only because a session happened to
have a BestPractice clone attached and happened to run `status` by hand.

The asymmetry that made this possible is worth stating plainly, because it
is the thing this tool closes. A CONSUMER repo vendors process/upstream/ as
tracked files, and its bootstrap runs a freshness check at session start --
so "your copy is behind" reaches a person without anyone deciding to look.
A SOURCE set had neither: `precedent_vendor_engine.py status` needs a local
clone of this repo to compare against, and a fresh session has no reason to
have one.

This runs from THIS repo's own checkout, which by definition IS that clone.
Every session working here already has, on disk, exactly what a source set
needs to answer the question -- so the check costs nothing and needs no
network beyond what is already fetched.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It never pushes and never opens a pull
request. `--apply` refreshes the vendored files and regenerates the views,
and `--commit` will commit that on a branch in the target repo; publishing
it stays a person's (or a session's) explicit act, per that repo's own
merge rules, which this tool has no way to know. Nor does --apply write
into a CONSUMER repo unless --path names it: one attached beside this
checkout is reported and left alone, because its engine and hooks move by
"Update Vendors" there, which checks and commits them (2026-09-26; the
story is in main()). And once --path names anything, --apply writes into
those repos and no others; every other one found is reported and left alone.

THERE IS NO UNATTENDED PATH, AND THAT IS THE DECISION (2026-09-14). This
paragraph used to end by naming one -- "the scheduled workflow the source
templates now ship" -- which was wrong twice over: the templates never
shipped one (added 2026-09-06, pulled the same day), and as of 2026-09-14
no repository runs a scheduled engine refresh at all. Morgan, in his own
words: "I think that engine-refresh.yml is now doing an automatic update
weekly. Let's stop that. No weekly updates. I had that weeks ago, but we're
not doing that anymore; this is now really complex and deserves hand
attention and issues come up every time and I'm on it every day anyway."
The replacement channel is a person saying "Update Vendors" in a session
(practices/vendor-update-runbook.md). So this tool's report, and the
session-start line it prints, are the whole notification story -- if
nobody is looking, nothing tells anybody.

CLARIFIED 2026-09-15: the paragraph above was about the WEEKLY, unattended
workflow specifically, not about a session's own bootstrap applying this
tool's report to its own working tree. Morgan: "my objection was to the
WEEKLY updates that were automatic; I never objected to START OF SESSION
checks that are automatic, I LOVE THAT." (strength: decided).
`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` now calls this with `--apply`
unconditionally, every session, for the reason its own comment gives: a
session working from a BestPractice checkout already has everything this
tool needs, so applying costs nothing further and closes the round trip
every earlier session had to make by hand (notice STALE, then run
--apply). This is still not the retired mechanism -- it runs once, inside
a session someone is sitting in, against that session's own working tree,
and it still never commits or pushes on its own; --commit remains a
separate, explicit flag. The dirty-tree check in the stale loop below
(added the same day) is what keeps this from being the auto-apply that
would have made 2026-09-14's decision moot: a source with its own
uncommitted changes is left alone rather than silently overwritten.

A SECOND THING THIS COVERS, AND WHY IT IS THE SAME TOOL (added
2026-09-09). A source set also carries its own session hooks -- the
freshness guard, the commit-identity backstop, and since 2026-09-13 the
individual-source bootstrap that makes the person's own practice set
resolve there at all -- installed by
tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py when the set is created. Sets created
BEFORE that existed never got them, and nothing has ever repaired one:
there was an install path and no refresh path, which is the same asymmetry
this tool was built to close for the vendored engine, one directory over.
Found on 2026-09-09 in a real individual source: a .claude/settings.json
present, .claude/hooks/ absent entirely, every session there running with
its guards off and nothing saying so.

Hooks are checked and repaired INDEPENDENTLY of engine staleness, because
they are independent: a set can be current at the tip and still have no
hooks at all, which is precisely the state that was found. An existing
settings.json is never rewritten -- if it wires something this tool does
not recognise, that is reported for a person to read, not resolved by
guesswork.

    engine files into a source clone and deliberately never commits them --

    Measured 2026-09-11: four private sources cloned at 11:00 by a
    pre-persist engine, the fix merged at 14:22, and a session at 15:49 --
    running the fixed code, with PRECEDENT_GIT_TOKEN set -- still met four
    clones that could not fetch. The freshness guard named
    `could not fetch origin/main` and refused every non-git tool call.

    This tool already walks every attached source at every session start,
    which makes it the one place that question gets asked for free. It writes
    no secret: the config records the environment variable's NAME (see
    precedent_source_credentials.persist_credential_helper). A clone that
    already has a helper is left alone, so this is idempotent and silent in
    the ordinary case."""
