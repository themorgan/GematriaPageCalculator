"""Check that philosophy/ cross-references run both ways.

Every item in the core philosophy documents carries a permanent slug. When
one item cites another, a reader landing on the cited end should be able to
find their way back -- so a citation is expected to be reciprocated, in the
cited item's own prose, the same way the forward citation is written.

This tool does NOT write those sentences. An earlier version generated a
`*Cited by: ...*` line under each cited item; Morgan read the result on
2026-09-11 and said it made the documents confusing -- machine output bolted
under prose reads as exactly that. So the back-reference is written by hand,
in the document's voice, and this tool only reports which ones are missing.

Experimental (2026-09-11). See philosophy/doc-recipes/backlinks.recipe.md.
