"""routing_eval_synthetic.py -- a targeted stress test of the occasion-index
channel, using eight hand-written synthetic tasks instead of real commits.

See evals/routing_synthetic/PREDICTION.md for why this exists, what it can
and cannot establish, and the pre-registered prediction it is scored
against. It reuses routing_eval.py's practice loader, loader block, and
answer-format machinery rather than re-deriving them -- only the case
source (synthetic, not git) and the oracle/control prompt text (built
around a synthetic diff instead of `git show`) are new.

Run:
  python3 tools/routing_eval_synthetic.py --emit         # oracle/control/treatment1
  python3 tools/routing_eval_synthetic.py --emit-hop2    # treatment2, after hop-1 answers exist
  python3 tools/routing_eval_synthetic.py --score        # score against the oracle
