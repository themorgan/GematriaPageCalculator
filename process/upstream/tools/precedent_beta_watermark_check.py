"""Say whether anyone other than you has pushed to precedent-beta-v01 since
you were last told, and only that once.

WHY THIS WAS NOT THE UPSTREAM-CARRY WATERMARK, ADAPTED (that check and
its watermark file were retired 2026-09-27). That
one gates an ACTION: "has `main` been carried onto this branch", and its own
comment is explicit that it must NOT auto-advance -- a person decides when a
carry has happened, so the notice keeps repeating until they run `--record`
themselves. This one gates a NOTIFICATION: "has Morgan been told that
someone else moved this branch". There is no action for him to perform to
make the notice stop -- he has simply been told -- so THIS watermark
auto-advances the moment it reports, in the same run. A notice that keeps
firing after it has already been delivered is exactly the failure
the carry watermark's own header named ("ignored by the second week"),
and the fix here is the mirror image of that file's: advance on report,
not on request.

WHERE THE WATERMARK LIVES: `tools/beta_branch_watermark.json`, HERE, since
2026-09-22. It lived at the root of the individual source until then, on
the argument that a record of what one person has already seen is not part
of this branch's history and would read as a personal read-receipt in a
public tree. Morgan overruled that, in those terms: the file holds a public
repository name, a public branch, a public commit SHA and a date; his own
my-identity-is-not-private practice covers his name appearing; and the
placement was tidiness, not privacy. It is keyed by identity inside, so a
second person on this branch is a second key rather than a second file --
"the last commit already reported" is true of a PERSON, not of a repo, and
one shared row would have each of them eating the other's notification.

WHAT THE MOVE COST, since it is not free. The write now lands in the very
checkout the session is about to work in, which the old placement made
impossible by construction. Two guards carry that: `_is_quiet` refuses to
write history into a checkout that is ahead of origin or has anything
staged, so a session-start hook can never publish work in progress or
author somebody's half-made commit; and `_commit_and_push` commits the one
path explicitly rather than whatever the index holds.

WHAT MOVES THE WATERMARK: AN ALERT, NOT A PUSH. Until 2026-09-22 this
file wrote and committed the watermark the moment `origin/<branch>` moved
at all -- above the `if not others` return, so the path that reports
NOTHING advanced and committed exactly like the path that reports someone
else's commits. Measured on `precedent-beta-v01` the same day: of the last
300 commits, 293 are Morgan's own, 5 a session's and 2 Alex's. So very
nearly every watermark commit ever written recorded the delivery of a
notice that was never delivered, and the registry's own `_comment` --
"gates a notification with nothing left to do once it has been given" --
described a contract the code did not keep. Counted in this container's
own clone of the individual source the same day: 32 watermark commits
across four days, 13 of them on 2026-09-21 alone, and 8 of the 32 still
sitting unpushed. The open item is
todo-2026-09-21-watermark-commits-pile-up-where-they-cannot-be-pushed
under todo/.

The write and the commit now sit BELOW that return. Nothing at all is
written on the quiet path -- not a commit, and not an uncommitted edit
either, which would leave that clone permanently dirty and stop
`.claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh` fast-forwarding it: a stuck checkout
in place of a diverged one. Letting the watermark go stale there is
harmless and is the point: `others` is computed over `seen..head`, so a
watermark that stayed put simply widens the window the next run reads, and
a commit nobody was told about is still found and still reported.

AND WHERE IT MOVES: NEVER WHERE IT CANNOT BE PUSHED. Moving the trigger
left the rarer half of the problem behind -- an alert still wrote a commit
into the individual source, and from a session rooted here that push could
not land: the git proxy serves fetches of that clone and refuses pushes on
repository scope, measured repeatedly on 2026-09-22 with the credential
helper present and the token in the environment. Eight unpushable commits
piled up there before the probe went in.

Relocating the file removes that particular wall and NOT the rule. The
alert path still probes with `push --dry-run` -- a real
authenticate-and-negotiate round trip that writes nothing -- because a
checkout that is offline, behind or diverged still cannot push, and a
commit written where it cannot be pushed is the whole failure. Where the
probe says no, or the checkout is not idle, nothing is written to the
shared file: the head just reported goes into this repository's gitignored
`.precedent/`, per container. That is all the shared watermark buys once it
cannot be written -- it stops the alert repeating HERE and claims nothing
about any other container -- and the note is written only where git can be
SHOWN to ignore it, because an untracked file in a source clone is the dirt
that skips that clone's refresh and reads as work existing nowhere else.

Raised by Morgan, 2026-09-18: Alex also pushes to this branch, and Morgan
wants to know when -- but not in every reply of a session, only once per
actual change. Two integration points, both calling `check()` /
`remind()` below rather than duplicating its logic:
  - `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` calls this file directly, once per
    session, and always prints a status line -- "unchanged" included.
  - `tools/precedent_gate.py`'s `reply` gate calls `remind()`, which is
    SILENT except on a real alert. A per-turn channel that repeated
    "unchanged" on every reply would be exactly the noise this file exists
    to remove; the session-start CLI above is where that status belongs.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_beta_watermark_check.py             # session start: always one line
  python3 tools/precedent_beta_watermark_check.py --no-fetch  # compare local refs only
  python3 tools/precedent_beta_watermark_check.py --no-push   # write + commit locally, skip the network push
                                                             # (this repo's own tools/, since 2026-09-22)

Exit status is always 0 (practice: fail-gracefully) -- a session start or a
reply that a network hiccup or a missing individual source could block is
worse than the notice it was trying to deliver.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-21). `_commit_and_push` used to run a bare
    `git commit -m`, trusting whatever `git config` held in the clone it was
    writing to. That clone is in a DIFFERENT REPOSITORY from the one this
    script runs in: the script runs in BestPractice and commits into the
    individual source. `commit-identity.sh` does reach sibling repos, and
    earlier in the same hook -- but when it cannot, it says so in a WARN and
    keeps going, and this ran anyway against an unconfigured clone.

    The trail is what forced the fix. Nineteen watermark commits on the
    individual source's `main` came out in THREE states, not two: authored
    correctly with the right offset; authored as the container with `+0000`;
    and -- twice -- authored as the container with the RIGHT offset. That
    third state is the proof the two halves are independent. The offset
    comes from the `env` block in settings.json, which follows a session
    into every repo it touches; the author comes from `git config` in one
    specific clone, which is the thing that has to be reached. Trusting an
    earlier step to have configured somebody else's repository is not a
    guarantee, so this stops trusting it and states the author on the
    command that writes the commit (practice: durable-fix).

    Degrades rather than fails: no identity, or an unreadable timezone, and
    the caller commits exactly as it did before. A watermark that cannot be
