# ---- THE SESSION-START WORK THAT IS NOT CLAUDE-CODE-SPECIFIC ------------
#
# Added 2026-09-21, and the gap it closes had been open since this script
# existed. templates/harness/README.md's adapter table told codex,
# gemini-cli and grok-build to wire "`bash tools/bootstrap.sh`, the same
# harness-neutral script" as their parallel of Claude Code's SessionStart
# hook -- but .claude/hooks/session-start.sh ran seven things and this
# script ran three, so the sentence named a parallel that was not one. The
# three steps below are the ones whose logic is plain Python in tools/,
# depends on nothing about the harness, and had simply never been invoked
# anywhere else.
#
# The one that matters most is the last: AGENTS.md's Standing instruction
# tells EVERY session to read .precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md, which
# carries the practices in force from every other source this repo
# declares. Nothing outside Claude Code has ever written that file, so a
# codex or gemini-cli session read the instruction, found no file, and
# worked without a single shared or individual practice -- silently, which
# is the same failure mode the file itself exists to prevent.
#
# Order matches session-start.sh's deliberately, so the two can be read
# against each other line by line. Each step reports and never gates,
# exactly like every other block here.

# Clone the declared SHARED sources, where the environment carries a
# credential (PRECEDENT_GIT_TOKEN / PRECEDENT_SOURCE_BASE_URL --
# documentation/PER_MACHINE_SETUP.md). No token, no network call: the tool
# says which sources are missing and why, and startup continues. The
# INDIVIDUAL source is not reachable from here on any harness -- it needs
# a per-account URL that no tracked file may carry (see
# templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/individual-source-bootstrap.sh.template),
# so on a harness with no equivalent of Claude Code's own per-adopter
# bootstrap hook it stays a manual step.

# Repair a single-branch clone's refspec before anything tries to fetch.
# A repository attached mid-session (Claude Code's `add_repo`, and any
# `git clone --single-branch`) is handed exactly one refspec --
# `+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main`. Push a feature branch from
# such a clone and the push genuinely succeeds, but no `origin/<branch>`
# ref is ever written, so every later `git rev-list origin/<branch>..HEAD`
# fails to resolve and the branch reads as "unpushed, no remote
# counterpart" forever -- including to a Stop hook that then blocks the
# turn. Seen 2026-09-06 on two consumer repos whose work was already
# safely on GitHub; the honest-looking remedy (push again) changes
# nothing, because the push was never the problem.
#
# Widening the refspec is local config only: it adds no commits, moves no
# refs, and re-running it is a no-op. Doing it here means the freshness
# block below can actually resolve origin/<branch> on a feature branch,
# which on a single-branch clone it silently could not.
# Only where an origin exists at all: a repo that has not been pushed yet has
# nothing to widen, and the NOTE below would be false there (measured on two
