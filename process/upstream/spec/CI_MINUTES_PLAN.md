# Cutting GitHub Actions minutes across every vendored repo

This organizes Morgan's 2026-09-16 conversation (seven ideas plus two
follow-on questions) against what is actually in this repo's tree and what
the account's own usage report shows, and pushes back on two of the seven
where the numbers or the existing design said something different than
the idea assumed. **Morgan approved phases 1–5 the same day** — "phases
1-5 approved... Go update!", holding items 6 and 7 for later (strength:
decided) — and "Sequencing and status" below says what that approval has
and has not reached yet.

## Where the minutes actually go — measured, not guessed

Morgan attached `usageReport_1_895e4cb647cb49859f1f4bee1f43d0d8.csv`, the
account's own Actions usage export, covering **2026-09-01 through the
morning of 2026-09-16** (his note: today's spike is not in this file).
Totals, computed directly from the file:

- **1,578 minutes** billed across 16 days — **$9.47 gross**, **$9.47
  discounted**, **$0.00 net** in every single row. The period cost nothing
  because a discount (almost certainly an included monthly minutes
  allowance) covered all of it — this file does not say how much of that
  allowance is left, or whether today's spike already used the rest of it.
  That number lives in GitHub's own Settings → Billing → Actions usage
  page, not in this export, and it is the one figure that actually says
  how close the account is to real dollars.

**By workflow, summed across every repo:**

| Minutes | Workflow | Status |
|---:|---|---|
| 532 | `bestpractice-docs.yml` | current template (`doc-lint.yml.template`) |
| 492 | `light-check.yml` | **not in this repo's tree at all** |
| 175 | `views-drift.yml` | current template, practice-set repos |
| 126 | `precedent-check.yml` | current template, practice-set repos |
| 81 | `commit-identity.yml` | not in this repo's tree as a workflow file |
| 42 | `personal-pack-sync.yml` | Morgan's own automation, not Precedent's |
| 36 | `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml` | **superseded**, per this repo's own migration doc |
| 29 | `status-claims-check.yml` | not in this repo's tree |
| 15 | `sync-voice-packs.yml` | Morgan's own automation |
| 11 | `unified-prompt-check.yml` | not in this repo's tree |
| 11 | `platform-docs-check.yml` | not in this repo's tree |
| 10 | `voicedef-pack-sync.yml` | Morgan's own automation |
| 7 | `practice-links-travel.yml` | not in this repo's tree |
| 4 | `sync-sound-human.yml` | Morgan's own automation |
| 4 | `engine-refresh.yml` | current template, practice-set repos |
| ≤2 each | `sync-voice-guidelines-to-sound-human.yml`, `voice-guidelines-sync.yml` | not in this repo's tree |

**By repo, personal repos not named here since this document is headed for
a public branch:** the busiest personal repo spent 433 minutes, the next
178, then a repo already named for its own deletion (132 — see Item 3), then
126, 65, 54, and fourteen more below 45 each. The four practice-set repos
are broken out separately since their numbers matter directly to items 4
and 5 below: precedent-individual 218, precedent-team-repo-maintenance 80,
precedent-team-working-style 50, precedent-team-writing 44.

**The finding that reframes items 1–3 below:** `light-check.yml`,
`commit-identity.yml` (as an ordinary dependent-repo workflow, not the
practice-set one), `status-claims-check.yml`, `unified-prompt-check.yml`,
`platform-docs-check.yml`, `practice-links-travel.yml`,
`bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml`, and the two `sync-voice-guidelines`
variants together burned **~659 minutes — 42% of the whole period** — and
**none of them exist as templates anywhere in this repo's current tree.**
`bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml` specifically is named in
[MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md)'s own text
as a scheduled sync workflow that "since 2026-09-14... there is no schedule
to pause" — it was replaced by something else in the current model, and
nothing ever removed the old file from the repos that installed it under
the old one. These are leftovers from before Precedent's rewrite, running
in repos that mostly haven't migrated onto the current engine yet, and
[tools/precedent_install.py](../tools/precedent_install.py)'s
`ci_workflows` field has no path to them at all — it only ever wrote
`bestpractice-docs.yml`.

Separately: `personal-pack-sync.yml`, `sync-voice-packs.yml`,
`voicedef-pack-sync.yml`, `sync-sound-human.yml`, and
`sync-voice-guidelines-to-sound-human.yml` (72 minutes total) are Morgan's
own domain automation — voice-pack and personal-data syncing — not
anything Precedent installs or owns. This plan flags them because they show
up in the same report, but treats them as his call, not something a sweep
touches on its own.

## Item 1 — `ci_workflows` default (already shipped, scope too narrow)

Verified in code: [tools/precedent_install.py](../tools/precedent_install.py)'s
`_bootstrap_and_ci` already skips writing `bestpractice-docs.yml` unless the
resolved individual or team
source declares `"ci_workflows": "enabled"`
([tools/precedent_identity.py](../tools/precedent_identity.py)'s
`ci_preference()`), and Morgan's own
`~/precedent-individual/identity.json` already declares it `"disabled"`.
**This part of item 1 is done, shipped 2026-09-15 — nothing to build.**

What is missing is scope: the toggle gates exactly one file. The table
above shows three more current templates a fresh install of a **practice
set** can carry — `precedent-check.yml`, `views-drift.yml`,
`engine-refresh.yml` — and none of them currently read `ci_workflows` at
all; wherever those get written today, they get written unconditionally.

**Proposed:** extend `_bootstrap_and_ci` (and the practice-set bootstrap
path that writes the other three) to gate every current CI template behind
the same single `ci_workflows` field, rather than adding one field per
template. A practice set that wants its own drift/check gates but not the
consuming-repo doc lint is a real but narrow case — flag it as an open
question below rather than building per-workflow granularity nobody has
asked for yet.

## Item 1a — a canonical install/upgrade questions document

**Yes, this gap is real.** Right now the questions a session asks during an
install or migration live in three places that say different things:
[SETUP.md](../SETUP.md) says *"ask exactly three questions"* (project
description, private-vocabulary blocklist, team/individual source);
[INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md)'s "Essentials Only" section and
[MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md)'s "Step 0"
ask about `visibility`,
`base_branch`, and which sources to declare, in prose, without being
counted or listed together. Nothing enumerates all of them in one place,
which is exactly the registry-source-of-truth gap the repo already has a
name for.

**Proposed:** a new `spec/INSTALL_QUESTIONS.md` — one table, one row per
question, each row saying when it's asked (fresh install / migration /
both), why, and what it's stored into. SETUP.md, INSTALL.md and
MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md then point at it instead of each carrying
their own count and their own wording — so "exactly three questions"
becomes "exactly N questions, listed here" once, and adding a question
means editing one table instead of three prose sections that can drift.

**Two new rows for that table, per Morgan's ask:**

- **Which LLM/agent platform will work in this repo** (Claude Code,
  GitHub-connected ChatGPT, other). Not a cosmetic field —
  [GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](../documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md) already explains that GitHub
  Actions exists partly to give a platform with no local shell (ChatGPT) the
  execution environment a platform with one does not need. The answer
  changes whether `ci_workflows` should default to disabled at all: for a
  ChatGPT-only repo, Actions may be the *only* place certain checks can run,
  which is a real argument for enabling it even under Morgan's own general
  preference.
- **`ci_workflows`: on or off** — asked explicitly, **default disabled**
  unless they say otherwise, matching item 1's already-shipped default and
  making the choice a recorded answer instead of a silent inherited value.

## Item 2 / 2a — retroactive default, widened past `bestpractice-docs.yml`

**Agreed on the framing.** There was no prior setting to revoke — flipping
existing installs to match the new default isn't changing anyone's choice,
it's applying the choice Morgan already made for future installs to the
ones that predate it. And 2a is right that the toggle needs to cover more
than one filename — the measured table above is the argument: 42% of the
period's minutes come from workflows the `ci_workflows` field has never
touched.

**One pushback, on mechanism rather than direction.** Not every legacy
workflow is safe to delete on sight. `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml`
specifically *did something* — a scheduled upstream sync — and
[MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md) says that
job was replaced by something
else in the current model, not simply dropped. Deleting the old file in a
repo that hasn't actually migrated onto the replacement would silently
stop that repo's upstream sync altogether, with nothing left to notice.
**So the sweep needs a per-file check, not a blanket delete:** for each
retired workflow name, confirm what replaced it (if anything) is present
and working in that repo *before* removing the old file, and only then
remove it. The other retired names in the table (`light-check.yml`,
`commit-identity.yml`, `status-claims-check.yml`,
`unified-prompt-check.yml`, `platform-docs-check.yml`,
`practice-links-travel.yml`) look like they were advisory checks with no
live replacement to verify — but that should be confirmed per file, once,
rather than assumed from here, since none of them have any trace in this
repo's history to check against directly.

**Superseded 2026-09-24 for `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml`.** The
replacement this pushback asked about is `Update Vendors`, present in every
repo that runs the engine, and the file's schedule had been gone since
2026-09-14. Morgan retired the file outright (strength: decided): *"this
needs to be deleted from ALL installs."* `precedent_vendor_engine.py
refresh` now deletes it, and `bestpractice-docs.yml`, by content, so the
per-file check this section asked for is the recogniser, not a person.
[vendor-update-runbook](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md) step 10 has
the session finish what the code will not. The other names here still need
the per-file read, and nothing deletes them by name.

## Item 2b — pushback: this repo's own three workflows are a different case

**I'm pushing back on this one rather than folding it in.**
docs.yml (retired 2026-09-21),
[deep-check.yml](../.github/workflows/deep-check.yml), and
[leak-gate.yml](../.github/workflows/leak-gate.yml) — BestPractice/Precedent's
own CI, not a template it ships — run unconditionally on every push, every
branch, by explicit design, and the design reasoning is written into each
file's own header. `leak-gate.yml`'s says it plainly: it is "the STRUCTURAL
backstop that a `git push --no-verify` cannot bypass, because it runs on
the server" — the entire point is that it runs *without* anyone asking for
it, because the person most likely to skip a private-vocabulary check on
purpose or by accident is the same person who would also skip opting a
check back in. Making it "off unless explicitly asked" removes exactly the
property that makes it worth having.

Two more reasons this is a different case from items 1–3:

- **This repo is public**, so its own Actions minutes are free on standard
  runners regardless of how often these three run — turning them off saves
  nothing on the number driving this whole conversation.
- **`docs.yml`'s 2026-09-14 widening to every branch was not an
  oversight.** Its own header cites a measured incident: a deliberately
  broken link planted in [spec/LOADER.md](LOADER.md) failed
  [tools/doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py) but was invisible to
  [tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py), and nothing else
  running on a push to `precedent-beta-v01` (the branch that carries
  essentially all of this repo's actual traffic, per
  [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)'s own routing rule) would have caught it before
  this change. Reverting it reopens that exact gap.

**What I'd keep:** BestPractice's own three workflows as a separate,
un-gated category — not subject to `ci_workflows`, not part of the sweep.
**What I'd fold into items 1–3 instead:** the CI *templates* this repo
vendors into other repos, which is what "off unless explicitly asked" is
actually a strong position on. I'd like Morgan's explicit sign-off before
touching this repo's own workflows either way, given the security
rationale on record — see Open Decisions below.

## Item 3 — the sweep, scoped to already-upgraded repos, inside migration

**Agreed with the shape as Morgan described it.** Operationally: "already
upgraded" means a repo that has been through
[MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md) or a fresh
§0/§1 install under the current engine — in practice, one with a
`precedent.json` on the current model. A
repo that hasn't migrated yet gets the sweep *as part of* that migration,
not as a separate pass beforehand — which also solves the "confirm the
replacement exists" problem from item 2, since migration is exactly the
moment the replacement gets installed.

**Proposed:** a new step in
[MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md) (and in
[vendor-update-runbook](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md), which
already "carries the merge" since 2026-09-14) that deletes retired
workflow files as part of that same pass, driven by a small registry list
(retired filename → what replaced it, if anything) rather than improvised
per repo — matching this catalogue's own `registry-source-of-truth`
practice, and giving the per-file check item 2b's pushback asked for a
single place to live instead of an ad hoc judgment call each time.

**One item that needs no plan at all:** the repo named above that's already
named for its own deletion burned 132 minutes in this window — still
running CI on every push. Archiving or deleting it removes that spend
today, independent of every other decision in this document.

## Item 4 — a debounce, not a schedule

Morgan's idea: keep every check running on push, but skip the run if the
last one for this workflow finished less than **X minutes** ago (default
**6 hours**, configurable), instead of trading push-triggered checks for a
fixed clock the way `doc-lint-scheduled.yml.template` already does. GitHub
Actions has no native "at most every N minutes" trigger, so this needs a
guard step at the top of the job: query the Actions API for the most
recent completed run of this workflow on this branch, and if it finished
inside the window, exit success immediately without running the actual
checks.

**Design:** a small shared script (one per template family, or one script
both `doc-lint.yml.template` and `precedent-check.yml.template` call),
reading a new field — `ci_debounce_minutes`, same resolution order as
`ci_workflows` — defaulting to `360` (Morgan's own 6-hour example) when
absent, `0` meaning "no debounce, check every push."

**Where I would and wouldn't apply it.** This directly answers Morgan's
other observation from yesterday about "200 checks... that slowed things
down" — a debounce collapses a burst of rapid pushes into one check per
window, which is a volume fix as much as a money one, and it's worth
applying broadly. The one place I'd hold it back is anything that exists
specifically to catch what nothing else catches — this repo's own
`leak-gate.yml` is the clearest example, per item 2b's reasoning: a
6-hour-stale leak gate is a leak gate that can miss the exact thing it
exists for, between windows. For advisory/drift checks like
[tools/doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py),
[tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py), and `views-drift`,
a few hours of staleness costs nothing nobody would notice by the next
real run.

## Item 5 — `concurrency: cancel-in-progress`, explained and checked

**What it does, plainly.** Every push normally starts its own full workflow
run that keeps going to completion even if a newer push lands seconds
later — you pay for and wait on an answer nobody reads, because the newer
commit already made it stale. A `concurrency` block tells GitHub the
opposite: group runs by branch, and when a new run starts, cancel whichever
older run for that branch is still in flight. A burst of rapid pushes then
bills for roughly one full run instead of one per push.

**Checked, directly in this repo's templates:**

- `templates/github-actions/doc-lint.yml.template` (retired 2026-09-21) **already had it**
  (`group: docs-${{ github.ref }}`, `cancel-in-progress: true`, added
  2026-09-15) — its own comment is honest about the limit: the job runs
  "well under a minute," so it only helps when two pushes land close enough
  together to actually overlap, which is the burst case and not the steady
  drip case (that's what item 4's debounce is for).
- `templates/github-actions/precedent-check.yml.template` and
  `templates/github-actions/views-drift.yml.template` (retired 2026-09-19) **did not have it** —
  a real gap, and the more valuable one of the two: `precedent-individual`
  alone spent 218 minutes across `views-drift.yml`, `commit-identity.yml`,
  and `precedent-check.yml` in this window, and the three team repos spent
  174 more between them, all without any cancel-in-progress protection.

**Cannot verify from here** whether the concurrency block that's already in
`doc-lint.yml.template` has actually landed in the personal repos it was
installed into — this session only has access to `alex137/bestpractice`,
not those repos. That check belongs in the same sweep as item 3.

## Item 6 — a self-hosted runner on your own server

**What it is, plainly.** A GitHub-hosted runner is a fresh virtual machine
(VM) GitHub spins up per job and bills by the minute. A self-hosted runner
is a long-lived
process you install on a machine you already control — your Linux server,
or a RunCloud instance — that GitHub Actions dispatches jobs to instead of
spinning up its own VM. The workflow YAML barely changes: `runs-on:
self-hosted` (or a custom label) in place of `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`.
**Minutes run there are not metered or billed by GitHub at all** — the cost
moves entirely to a machine you're already paying for.

**The honest trade-offs:**

- It's a standing operational commitment, not a one-time setting: you keep
  the runner process alive, patch the box, and a hung job or a dead runner
  is now something you debug instead of something GitHub absorbs.
- **Security, and this repo already reasons about the relevant risk.**
  GitHub's own guidance against self-hosted runners on repos taking
  untrusted forked PRs is the same risk this repo's own `leak-gate.yml`
  names when it says "PUT `pull_request:` BACK IF A PR EVER ARRIVES FROM A
  FORK" — a workflow can run arbitrary code from whatever triggered it. For
  the private, single-author repos in this usage report that's not a live
  risk; it would become one the moment any of them started taking outside
  contributions on a self-hosted runner.
- Best fit as a **pilot on the highest-volume, lowest-sensitivity jobs**
  first — the Markdown-lint job in `doc-lint.yml.template`/`light-check.yml`
  on the two busiest personal repos named above (433 and 178 minutes),
  rather than a blanket migration of every workflow at once.

This is a bigger, slower-moving piece than items 1–5; I'd sequence it as
its own later phase rather than let it hold up the rest of this plan.

## Item 7 — the usage report

Covered above, under "Where the minutes actually go." The one thing worth
restating here: **the reported period cost $0.00 net**, fully covered by a
discount this file doesn't explain the size of. The real risk Morgan named
— crossing into real dollars as more projects and more usage arrive — is
forward-looking, and this file can't answer how close that ceiling
actually is. Checking Settings → Billing → Actions directly, for the
account's included-minutes ceiling and how much of it this cycle has
already used (including today's excluded spike), is worth doing before
any of the rest of this plan, since it's the number that says how urgent
the rest of it actually is.

## Item 8 — field validation: debounce alone did not stop a live spike (2026-09-19)

Item 4's own text flagged this as untested: "its first real run on any
adopting repo is worth watching." This is that run, and what it showed
changes the recommendation in Open decision 3 below.

**What happened.** Morgan's account usage report showed 183 minutes billed
on 2026-09-18 and 165 by noon on 2026-09-19 — a session diagnosed it in
that repo, not this one, because the driver was four of Morgan's private
practice sets (`precedent-individual`, `precedent-team-writing`,
`precedent-team-repo-maintenance`, `precedent-team-working-style`),
accounting for 86% of the 2026-09-19 total before noon. All four had
`precedent-check.yml`/`views-drift.yml` installed per "Install in a
Practice-Set Repository" ([GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](../documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)) — debounce guard included,
running at its 360-minute default, exactly as Phase C shipped it.

**Why the debounce guard didn't stop it.** Debounce (Item 4's own design)
skips the *rest* of the job when the last completed run on the branch
finished inside the window — but the checkout step and the debounce guard
step itself are not behind that gate; they run on every trigger,
unconditionally, by construction (the guard has to check out the repo and
call `gh run list` before it can know whether to skip anything else).
GitHub bills in whole minutes, so a "skipped" run is not a free run — it's
a cheap one. The four sets carry `push:` with no `branches:` restriction
(2026-09-14, per each workflow's own comment) and no `paths:` filter
(deliberate, per the same comment), so every push to every session's
`claude/*` working branch paid that baseline, and there were dozens of
such branches across the four repos. Debounce collapses the *expensive*
tail of a run; it does nothing about trigger *volume*, which turned out
to be the actual cost driver once real branch churn hit it.

**Fix applied, 2026-09-19, directly in the four repos** (this session has
push access there; BestPractice's own session-scoped access still does
not reach Morgan's other repositories, per "Sequencing and status" below):
`push:` restricted to `branches: [main]` in both workflows, and the
debounce window tightened from 360 to 30 minutes (`ci_debounce_minutes`,
in `identity.json` where one exists) —
[precedent-individual#153](https://github.com/themorgan/precedent-individual/pull/153),
[precedent-team-writing#41](https://github.com/themorgan/precedent-team-writing/pull/41),
[precedent-team-repo-maintenance#87](https://github.com/themorgan/precedent-team-repo-maintenance/pull/87),
[precedent-team-working-style#41](https://github.com/themorgan/precedent-team-working-style/pull/41),
all merged. **The tradeoff accepted**: a `claude/*` branch pushed to
directly now gets zero automatic CI until it reaches `main` — verified
locally instead, via the same mechanical checks the merge runbook already
runs before a merge commits (deep-check's own Rule: "the same set the
merge runbook already runs on every merge"), so a session following its
own process loses no real coverage; what's lost is the independent,
externally-visible backstop for a merge that skips that process.

**Not done here at the time**: the templates themselves still shipped
`push:` with no branch restriction. Done the same day, item 9 below.

## Item 9 — the templates themselves, so a future install doesn't repeat item 8 (2026-09-19)

Item 8 fixed four already-installed repos by hand. Nothing about that
touched the **templates** those repos originally installed from — a
practice set bootstrapped today ([tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py](../tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py)), or any
repo freshly given `precedent-check.yml`/`doc-lint.yml` by
[tools/precedent_install.py](../tools/precedent_install.py), would still get the design that caused the
incident. Fixed the same day, once Morgan asked whether it needed to be
done in BestPractice (BP) too — he did: "does this fix need to be
implemented in BP so that future repos we create with it don't have that
issue?" `strength: decided` ("Yes, go ahead and implement it").

**Three changes, all three templates:**

1. `precedent-check.yml.template` and `views-drift.yml.template` are now
   **one template**, `precedent-check.yml.template` — the same merge item
   8 applied to the four repos, now upstream. `views-drift.yml.template`
   no longer exists; installing `precedent-check.yml.template` installs
   both checks, as its `precedent-check` and `views-drift` jobs.
2. **Debounce moved into its own job in all three templates**
   (`doc-lint.yml.template` included, previously a single job with a
   debounce STEP — the same step-vs-job distinction item 8 measured: a
   step-level skip still bills the job's own runner-minute, a job-level
   `if:` that evaluates false is never billed at all).
3. **`pull_request: [opened, synchronize]` added back to all three,
   alongside `push:` scoped to `branches: [main]`** — not push
   unrestricted (item 8's own problem) and not push-restricted-alone
   (item 8's *first* fix, which gave up automatic verification on
   anything short of a merge — a different repo's CI catching a real
   error on an open PR the same day is what changed Morgan's mind on
   that trade). Each template's own header documents how to widen the
   branch list for a repo whose routine merge target isn't just `main` —
   this repo's own `docs.yml`/`deep-check.yml` (not `leak-gate.yml`,
   deliberately: see below) got the same treatment, listing
   `[main, precedent-beta-v01]`.

**Why this doesn't reintroduce the exact duplicate-run problem
`doc-lint.yml.template`'s own header already measured** (235 runs in
matched pairs, before `pull_request:` was dropped entirely on
2026-09-15): that measurement was push running on *every* branch,
overlapping `pull_request:synchronize` on any branch with an open PR.
With push now scoped to only the named branch(es) — never a PR's own
head — a PR's branch only ever gets `pull_request` events and a named
branch only ever gets `push` events. Nothing fires twice for the same
commit. This repo's own `leak-gate.yml` was deliberately left alone: its
every-branch scope is a security backstop (a leak is exposed the instant
it's pushed to this public repo, PR or not), not a cost or coverage
trade, so the branch-scoping reasoning above does not apply to it.

**Documented, not just changed**, per Morgan's own instruction that this
be written up for whoever adapts it: [templates/github-actions/README.md](../templates/github-actions/README.md)
has the trigger shape and the branch-list customization point up front;
[GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](../documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)'s "Controlling Actions Minutes" and "Install in a
Practice-Set Repository" sections carry the mechanical detail; this item
is the incident and reasoning. [TODO.md](../TODO.md)'s
[`views-drift-vs-suite-workflow`](../todo/todo-2026-09-13-views-drift-vs-suite-workflow.md)

## Item 9a — two engine-level gaps items 8-9's hand-fixes exposed (2026-09-19)

Re-baselining `ci_workflows_sha256` by hand in the four repos item 8 fixed
(dropping a stale hash after each one's hand-applied fix, and a stale
`views-drift.yml` tracking entry in `themorgan/precedent-individual` left
over from item 9's own consolidation) surfaced two gaps in
[tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)
itself, not just in those repos' manifests:

1. **No retirement mechanism for CI workflow templates.**
   `RETIRED_ENGINE_FILES`/`_remove_dropped_engine_files` already handle
   this for ordinary vendored files under [tools/](../tools/); `ci_workflow_files`/
   `ci_workflows_sha256` had no equivalent, so folding
   `views-drift.yml.template` into `precedent-check.yml.template` left
   every set that already had it tracked with a stale manifest entry
   `refresh()` would read as a missing, hand-edited file — refusing the
   whole run — the next time it ran there. Fixed with
   `RETIRED_CI_WORKFLOW_FILES` (a tombstone dict mirroring
   `RETIRED_ENGINE_FILES`) and `_remove_retired_ci_workflow_files`, called
   unconditionally at the top of `refresh()`: a retired entry is dropped
   from the manifest automatically, and — as of 2026-09-20, item 11 below —
   a retired file still on disk is deleted when it is still exactly what
   the manifest last recorded (untouched since), and kept and reported
   otherwise. `refresh()` is the shared code path both "Update Vendors"
   and an existing repo's migration route through, so this reaches both
   without a separate fix in either.
2. **No way to re-baseline a CI workflow's recorded hash without a full
   clone.** `record_ci_workflow_files()` already does exactly this —
   record what's on disk, touch no content — but was reachable only from
   inside [tools/precedent_install.py](../tools/precedent_install.py)/
   [tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py](../tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py) at
   install time, or by importing the module directly (which is what
   fixing the two dependent repos' stale hashes above actually took). A
   session hand-fixing a CI workflow file mid-incident has no supported
   way to tell the manifest the fix is correct short of
   `refresh --force` against a live clone, which would overwrite the
   hand-authored fix with the generic template. The new `record-ci`
   subcommand (clone-free, like `fresh`) closes this.

Both verified against scratch fixtures reproducing each incident, and
covered by a new `check_vendor_engine_retires_ci_workflow_files` in
[tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py) (11 cases) alongside
the existing CI-workflow refresh coverage. Deep check run clean before
push, same as item 9.

## Item 10 — item 6 generalized: a runner override any adopter can opt into (2026-09-20)

Item 6's self-hosted-runner pilot is scoped to Morgan's own repos — it
solves the metered-minutes problem for the account running the pilot, not
for anyone else who installs Precedent as open-source software into their
own repo. Raised the same way: **"a self-hosted runner solves the problem
FOR ME, but not for the other random people we want to use this open
source software."**

Two things were already true and needed no work: a **public** repo's
Actions minutes are unmetered on standard runners regardless of any of
this, so an open-source adopter who keeps their repo public already gets
item 6's outcome for free; and for a **private** adopter, the four levers
items 1–5/8/9 already ship (opt-in `ci_workflows`, branch-scoped
`push:`/`pull_request:`, the job-level debounce, `concurrency`) already
shrink cost automatically, with no setup, for every install.

**What was missing:** the templates had no way for an adopter who *does*
already operate a self-hosted runner to point their own install at it
without hand-editing the workflow file. Added:
`runs-on: ${{ vars.PRECEDENT_RUNNER || 'ubuntu-latest' }}` on every job in
doc-lint.yml.template (retired 2026-09-21)
and
[precedent-check.yml.template](../templates/github-actions/precedent-check.yml.template).
Unset, nothing changes for anyone. Set as a repository variable, every job
in that workflow moves to the named runner — the same escape hatch item 6
describes, generalized from something only this session can apply to
Morgan's own repos into something any adopter can flip for themselves.
Documented in [documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](../documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)'s
"Controlling Actions Minutes" (now four levers, plus the public-repo note)
and [templates/github-actions/README.md](../templates/github-actions/README.md).

**This does not replace item 6/Phase D.** Whether to actually run a
self-hosted-runner pilot on Morgan's own repos, and which ones, is still
open — this item only makes the mechanism available to whoever wants it,
including Morgan, without deciding the pilot question for him.

**Reaches dependent repos only when they take an update.** Per
`vendor-rollout-disclosed`: this changes shipped template content
(`templates/github-actions/*.template`), so it needs
[vendor-update-runbook](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md)'s normal
"Update Vendors" path to reach an already-installed repo — nothing here
pushes it there automatically, and a repo on an older template keeps
running unconditionally on `ubuntu-latest` until it takes that update.

Authorized: *"On #3 -- do it, go update -- and also update the developer
documentation."* strength: decided.

## Item 11 — debounce default unified and widened to 720 minutes (2026-09-20)

Raising it further was Morgan's own call, after item 8/9's account above:
*"Please let's raise it to 720."* `strength: decided`.

**Found while making the change: the two templates had already drifted to
different defaults.** doc-lint.yml.template (retired 2026-09-21)
still shipped item 9's original `360`; [precedent-check.yml.template](../templates/github-actions/precedent-check.yml.template)
had item 8's incident-driven `30` baked in as its own default, not just as
the four affected repos' per-repo override — [documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](../documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)
claimed one shared default of `360` for both the whole time, which was
already wrong for the second template before this item. Both templates now
read `ci_debounce_minutes` with a single default, **`720` minutes (12
hours)**, and the doc is corrected to match.

**What this reopens, named rather than left implicit.** Item 8's own
30-minute figure was not arbitrary — its narrowing was paired with the
`branches:[main]` restriction specifically so the one branch that matters
would still be checked promptly after a push, rather than riding out a work
day stale. Widening to 720 minutes brings that same window back to up to 12
hours on `main`. This trade is accepted here, explicitly, at Morgan's
direction, not overlooked — a repo that wants the tighter window back on a
branch with heavy traffic still sets `ci_debounce_minutes` itself in its
own `identity.json`/`precedent.json`, same as it always could.

**Reaches an already-installed repo only through "Update Vendors"**, per
[vendor-rollout-disclosed](../practices/vendor-rollout-disclosed.md): a
repo that has never overridden `ci_debounce_minutes` picks up `720`
automatically the next time it refreshes its CI workflow file against the
current template (`refresh()`'s hash check, item 9a above, only refuses
when the file was hand-edited away from what was last recorded — an
unmodified copy is exactly what it *will* overwrite). **A repo carrying an
explicit override does not move on its own** — the four repos item 8
touched by hand (`precedent-individual`, `precedent-team-writing`,
`precedent-team-repo-maintenance`, `precedent-team-working-style`) each
still has `ci_debounce_minutes: 30` written into its own `identity.json`,
and that value wins over any template default until someone edits it there
directly. This session's own GitHub access does not reach those repos (see
"Sequencing and status" below) — carrying the same change into them is
still open.

Verified: both templates still parse as valid YAML; deep check
([tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py), [tools/doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py),
[tools/leak_gate.py](../tools/leak_gate.py), [tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py),
[tools/doc_sync.py](../tools/doc_sync.py)) run clean before push.

## Item 12 — leak-gate vendored, visibility-aware branch scope (2026-09-20)

Raised against a real case: a private repo (32 branches, nearly all
transitory) inheriting BestPractice's own `leak-gate.yml` design of
scanning every branch on every push — reasonable for this repo, since it is
public and a leak on any branch is already published, but not obviously
right for a private repo where the audience of an early leak is whoever
already has repo access, not the public internet. Proposed as a job-level
runtime check keyed off `precedent.json`'s existing `visibility` and
`base_branch` fields, described to Morgan before building since it touches
security-gating code; authorized the same day: *"Please build this."*
`strength: decided`.

**What shipped.** [`templates/github-actions/leak-gate.yml.template`](../templates/github-actions/leak-gate.yml.template) —
the first time `leak-gate.yml` has been vendored to a dependent repo or
practice set at all. Its own header has the full design reasoning; in
short: `on:` cannot read repo config (GitHub Actions resolves triggers
before any job runs), so the workflow still fires on every push, and a
`scope` job decides whether the real `leak-gate` job runs at all —
job-level `if:`, never a step-level one, so a skip is never billed (item 9's
lesson, reapplied here). On a repo declaring `"visibility": "private"`, a
`push` to any branch other than `base_branch` (default `main`) skips the
scan; a `pull_request:` event is never skipped, whatever branch it targets,
so a fork's contribution still gets scanned before it can land. A public
repo (visibility absent or `"public"`) is unaffected — every push to every
branch is scanned, matching this repo's own `leak-gate.yml` exactly. A
practice SET (no `precedent.json`, only `precedent-source.json`, which
always declares `"visibility": "private"`) is always treated as private
here, with no field to opt out of.

**The trade, stated once more since it is the whole point of item 2b's
original reasoning being repo-specific rather than universal:** a secret
pushed to a private repo's throwaway branch and never merged is caught only
if the local pre-push hook ran, until that branch reaches `base_branch` or
someone runs it by hand (`workflow_dispatch:`, never skipped). This is the
same trade item 8 already made by hand for four real repos when branch
volume was the measured cost driver; this generalizes it into a template
instead of a one-off edit.

**Wired into the vendoring engine, not just written as a file:**
`CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES` in
[tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py) now
lists it for both `consumer` and `source` kinds, so "Update Vendors"
refreshes, drift-checks and can retire it exactly like the other two CI
templates, with no separate mechanism. `precedent_bootstrap_source.py`'s
own `WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES` (which asserts it stays in lockstep with the
engine's `'source'` list) carries the matching entry. `precedent_install.py`'s
`_bootstrap_and_ci`, which used to hardcode writing `doc-lint.yml.template`
alone, now loops `CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES['consumer']` — so this and any
future consumer-kind CI template need no second copy of that block, gated
by the same `ci_workflows` preference as before.

**Verified:** the extracted config-reading logic against seven fixtures
(no config, private with and without a declared `base_branch`, explicit
public, an invalid `visibility` value, a source-kind manifest with no
`visibility` key at all, and malformed JSON) — every failure mode resolves
to `public`/`main`, the safe direction, never a silent under-scan.

**That last clause was wrong, and was corrected 2026-09-21.** Those seven
fixtures cover config that is MISSING or MALFORMED. None of them covers
config that is present, well-formed and **factually wrong**, which is the
case that actually occurred: `precedent_bootstrap_source.py` writes
`"visibility": "private"` into every `precedent-source.json` it creates,
and two of Morgan's practice sets carrying that line are **public on
GitHub**. The gate would have read "private", skipped every working-branch
push, and reported green — on a repo where a leaked secret is published to
the world the instant it is pushed. The template now takes visibility from
`github.event.repository.private`, which GitHub supplies and no file in the
tree can contradict; the declaration is still read, still reported, and can
no longer narrow the scan. Its own scope-job comment carries the incident. The
gate's bash decision logic checked against the five real event/visibility/
branch combinations that matter. `python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(...)"`
on every edited `.py` file and a full YAML parse of the new template.
`tools/doc_lint.py`, `tools/precedent_check.py`, `tools/leak_gate.py`, and
`tools/verify_harness.py` all run clean before push.

**Not done here:** actually installing `leak-gate.yml` into the private
repo that motivated this item, or any other existing dependent repo — that
is a per-repo "Update Vendors" (for an already-installed repo) or a fresh
install/migration pass, same as any other CI template, and this session's
GitHub access does not reach that repo to check what it currently has
installed, if anything.

## Item 13 — the debounce job could never pay for itself; one job per workflow (2026-09-20)

Raised by Morgan the same day item 11 shipped, against a fresh usage
export: **134 minutes billed in the first three hours of 2026-09-20**, with
the four practice sets carrying items 8/9/11's full fix contributing 71 of
them. Items 4, 8, 9 and 11 had all aimed at this number over five days and
none of them had moved it. His framing, and the reason this item exists:
he intends to **20x** his usage, at which point today's shape is not an
annoyance but a budget.

**What every earlier item had in common.** Concurrency, branch scoping and
the debounce window all reduce **how often** a run is paid for. None of them
touches **what one run costs**. Nobody had measured what one run costs.

**The measurement, taken in a clone of an installed practice set:**

| What the runner is there to do | Time |
|---|---:|
| [`tools/precedent_check.py`](../tools/precedent_check.py) | 0.35s |
| [`tools/build_views.py`](../tools/build_views.py) `--check` | 0.12s |
| **Total useful work** | **0.47s** |
| **Billed for it under the shape item 9 shipped** | **3 minutes** |

GitHub bills **per job, rounded up to the whole minute**. Three jobs
(`debounce`, `precedent-check`, `views-drift`) is three billed minutes,
three checkouts and three Python setups, for under half a second of work.
The overhead is not a tax on the cost — it very nearly *is* the cost.

**The arithmetic that retires the debounce job.** Item 9's reasoning was
that a job whose `if:` evaluates false is reported SKIPPED, never allocates
a runner, and is not billed. That is true, and it is not the whole ledger:
**the job that makes the decision is billed like any other job.** With `S`
the fraction of triggers the window skips:

```
precedent-check.yml   debounce + 2 check jobs:  S·1 + (1−S)·3  =  3 − 2S
                      one job, no debounce:                         1

doc-lint.yml          debounce + 1 check job:   S·1 + (1−S)·2  =  2 − S
                      one job, no debounce:                         1
```

Both are worse than no debounce for **every** `S` below 1, tying only at a
hypothetical 100% skip rate — at which point the workflow is doing nothing
at all. There is no window setting that wins. That is why `360 → 30 → 720`
(items 8, 9 and 11) never showed up in the bill: **the quantity being tuned
was not the one doing the spending**, and three days of tuning it was three
days not spent counting jobs.

**It also gave up coverage for nothing.** Item 11 accepted, explicitly, that
`main` could now sit unchecked for up to 12 hours. That trade bought
negative savings. Removing the debounce returns the 12 hours and costs less.

**What shipped.**

1. `precedent-check.yml.template`: **3 jobs → 1**. The `debounce` job is
   gone; `views-drift`'s steps moved into the `precedent-check` job, keeping
   their own step names and failure messages (which is all the separate job
   was buying — the file's own "FOUR NAMED STEPS, NOT ONE" comment already
   made that argument about steps within a job). One checkout at
   `fetch-depth: 0` serves both checks. `actions: read` dropped with the job
   that needed it.
2. `doc-lint.yml.template`: **2 jobs → 1**, same reasoning, same dropped
   scope. Its `paths:` filter already did the debounce's job better and for
   free — GitHub evaluates `paths:` *before* allocating a runner, so a push
   touching no Markdown costs zero, which no in-workflow guard can match.
3. `ci_debounce_minutes` is retired. Nothing reads it; a repo carrying it
   can delete the field.

**Cost per firing trigger: 3 minutes → 1 for a practice set, 2 → 1 for a
consuming repo** — before counting the two redundant checkouts and Python
setups that go with the jobs.

**`paths:` is still absent from `precedent-check.yml.template`, deliberately**
— the file's own comment gives the reason (this repo's checks read
frontmatter, the engine, `checked_by:` scripts and `precedent.json`, so a
filter that misses one input is a green workflow that checked nothing).
That reason holds. It is worth revisiting only with a filter derived from
the inputs rather than guessed at.

Authorized: *"Go update with your changes."* `strength: decided`. Classified
**high-risk** under [go-update](../practices/go-update.md) — vendored gating
code that other repos install — so it took the full chain rather than the
direct-push default.

**What this does NOT fix, and it is most of the bill.** Everything above is
a template change, and per `vendor-rollout-disclosed` a template reaches an
installed repo only through "Update Vendors". On the 2026-09-20 export,
**18 of the 22 repos spending minutes have never taken one** — and the two
largest single line items are not Precedent's to fix from here at all:
`light-check.yml` (609 minutes month-to-date, 23.5% of everything, live in
12 repos) and `bestpractice-docs.yml` copies predating the `paths:` filter.
Phase B's own status line above calls the retired workflows "cosmetic, not
a live cost" on the grounds that their triggers no longer fire on an
ordinary push. **Its conclusion is wrong and its premise is right**, which
this item originally got backwards — see item 14.

## Item 14 — the sweep this plan authorized deleted live checks, and this repo already had a practice saying it would (2026-09-20)

Item 13's closing paragraph sent a session to delete six "retired" workflow
files across sixteen repos. It ran. **The instruction was wrong in a way
this repository had already written down**, and the correction belongs here
rather than in the sweep's own thread.

**What the sweep found, reading the files instead of their names.** Every
deleted file triggered on `pull_request` (plus `workflow_dispatch`). **Not
one had a `push:` trigger.** So Phase B's premise was correct all along:
they do not fire on push. The usage export was also correct: they bill. Both
are true, because **the minutes arrive through pull-request volume** — about
fourteen PR runs a day in the busiest repo — not through pushes. Item 13
read "the export says they bill" as "so the no-push premise must be false",
which does not follow, and anyone auditing for `push:` triggers on the
strength of that sentence will keep finding nothing and keep concluding the
export is lying.

**The serious error: "pre-Precedent leftovers with no replacement" was an
inference, not a finding.** Its only basis was this document's own table
saying those filenames are "not in this repo's tree at all" — which means
BestPractice never templated them, and says nothing whatsoever about
whether the repo carrying one needs it. The sweep measured what they
actually ran:

- one repo's `light-check.yml` ran a check script under its own
  `tools/checks/`, materialized from current Precedent sources;
- another's ran `tools/precedent_check.py --only light-check`;
- three voice repos' `unified-prompt-check.yml` / `platform-docs-check.yml`
  gated generated-prompt staleness, and one of those repos vendors another's
  generated prompt daily — so a stale prompt can now reach a live app.

These were current-engine checks for live rules. Deleting them removed
coverage in nine repos and bought nothing back, because the cost was never
in what they checked.

**This repo predicted it, twice, in writing.**
[spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md)'s own
retired-file table — the authority item 13 should have consulted and did not
— says of exactly these five names: *"Confirm in the repo carrying the file
what each one actually checks before touching it; a check with no equivalent
anywhere in the current engine is a gap to raise with the person, not a file
to delete on a guess."*
[vendor-update-runbook](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md) step 10 says
it in bold: *"Never match by filename alone before touching anything on this
list"*, and cites this same `light-check.yml` case from earlier the same day.
And [workflow-file-outside-vendoring](../practices/workflow-file-outside-vendoring.md)
exists **because a session already made this precise mistake**: it built a
fleet-wide sweep list by matching usage-report filenames, flagged
`light-check.yml` as a retired duplicate, and a sister session proved it was
a live required check. Item 13 reproduced that failure from the same source,
and this time the deletions were pushed.

**The mechanism, stated so it is not re-derived wrongly a third time:** a
filename in a usage report tells you a workflow costs money. It tells you
nothing about what the workflow does. Only reading the file does that, and
`verify-decomposition` is the practice — check the parts, never the total.

**Also corrected here:** item 13's sweep figures (735 minutes across six
files, 609 for `light-check.yml`) are right against the export, but the
per-repo list handed to the sweep dropped four already-deleted `DEPRECATED-*`
repos worth 73 minutes without restating the totals, so the session
reasonably found 662 and 542 and reported the arithmetic as broken. The
totals and the list were measuring different sets.

**One thing the sweep got right that item 13 got wrong by omission:**
`bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml` is kept everywhere.
[spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md) step 6
names it as the counter-example — *a hold with a stated condition for
lifting it, which is exactly what distinguishes one from a leftover* — and
it is `workflow_dispatch`-only in every copy since its crons came off, so
deleting it saves nothing forward.

**Reversed 2026-09-24.** The hold that quote describes had ended on
2026-09-14, and the file stayed on a reason nobody re-read. Saving minutes
was never the case for deleting it: it was the only reader of the Claude
keys in each repo that carried it, and it did nothing `Update Vendors` does
not. It is now retired and deleted by the refresh (see item 2/2a's note).

## Item 15 — the same one-minute floor, measured in a consuming repo (2026-09-21)

Item 13 measured the per-job billing floor in a **practice set**: 0.47
seconds of work billed as three minutes, fixed by collapsing three jobs into
one. A session working the sweep across Morgan's **consuming** repos reached
the identical conclusion from the other direction, and its numbers belong
here rather than only in a chat thread.

**What it measured.** In the busiest consuming repo, the light check is a
**13-second job**, billed at GitHub's one-minute-per-job floor, running on
roughly **14 pull-request runs a day**. That is about **420 minutes a month
from one repo**, with nothing misconfigured — the floor is the entire cost.
The same repo also runs the vendored `bestpractice-docs.yml` on the same
pull request, so **two workflows bill two one-minute minimums for about
twenty seconds of combined work**.

**Two levers it ruled out, correctly.** `concurrency: cancel-in-progress`
does nothing at a 13-second runtime: the superseded run has almost always
finished before the newer one starts, so there is nothing to cancel.
And `paths:` filters, added during the same pass and derived from each
check's own extension list rather than guessed, are free and correct but
will not recover much here — the repo's pull requests are overwhelmingly
Markdown and Markdown is inside the filter. A filter only helps where the
excluded extensions are what people actually touch.

**The lever that remains is the one item 13 already named: job count.** Two
workflows on one pull request is two floors; one workflow with one job is
one. Folding the vendored doc lint's work into a repo's own check job halves
the per-pull-request floor with no coverage lost.

**How to remove the now-redundant vendored workflow — corrected 2026-09-21.**
This item first said to set `ci_workflows: disabled` in the consuming repo's
`precedent.json` and then delete the file. **That is wrong on three counts,
and the session told to do it read the engine and refused, correctly.**
[`ci_preference()`](../tools/precedent_identity.py) resolves
`ci_workflows` from an **`identity.json` in an individual or team SOURCE** —
this repo's own when it *is* an individual source, otherwise the one the
user-level config names. A `ci_workflows` key written into a consuming
repo's `precedent.json` is read by nothing. It is also not a runtime gate:
[GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](../documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md) says it "only
changes what [precedent_install.py](../tools/precedent_install.py) writes by default". And its default is
already `disabled`, so setting it authorises nothing that was not already
true. The sequence would have written an inert key and left a plain deletion
carrying a commit message claiming a toggle permitted it — item 14's mistake
with a fig leaf.

**The real removal path** is the one the engine already enforces:
[precedent_decommission.py](../tools/precedent_decommission.py) refuses to
retire a workflow whose `on:` carries more than `workflow_dispatch`, and
[practice_audit.py](../tools/practice_audit.py) checks the manifest against
the tree. A vendored
workflow is retired through those, against its manifest entry, or it is not
retired.

**What this does not license.** Dropping `pull_request: synchronize` to cut
the four-to-five runs a branch accumulates would trade away per-push
verification on open pull requests — the coverage item 9 restored after
item 8 gave it up, on the strength of a real error caught that way. The run
volume is the cost of the review model, not a misconfiguration, and it is
not the thing to cut.

Authorized: *"Go update - fix the leak-gate template and add item 15."*
`strength: decided`.

## Sequencing and status

Morgan approved phases 1–5 on 2026-09-16, holding items 6 and 7 for later
(tracked in
[todo/todo-2026-09-16-revisit-ci-minutes-items-6-7.md](../todo/todo-2026-09-16-revisit-ci-minutes-items-6-7.md),
due 2026-09-19). **What "done" means here is scoped to this repository**:
this session can build and merge everything BestPractice itself owns — the
installer, the templates, the migration and update runbooks — but it
cannot push to Morgan's other repositories, which are outside this
session's GitHub access. Turning any of this ON for a given dependent
repo, practice set, or team repo is still a separate action in that
repo, the next time it installs, migrates, or takes an update.

- **Phase A — done.** `ci_workflows` gates every current CI template, not
  only `bestpractice-docs.yml` (item 1);
  [spec/INSTALL_QUESTIONS.md](INSTALL_QUESTIONS.md) is the canonical
  install/migration question list, with the two new questions added and
  SETUP.md/INSTALL.md/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md pointed at it (item
  1a); `precedent-check.yml.template` (which now also carries what
  `views-drift.yml.template` used to, item 9) carries the same
  `concurrency` block `doc-lint.yml.template` already had (item 5).
  Archiving the repo already named for its own deletion is still
  Morgan's to do — that repo is outside this session's reach.
- **Phase B — the retired-workflow deletion sweep still hasn't run
  anywhere; the costly part reached all four repos on its own, ahead of
  it (verified 2026-09-19).** *(2026-09-24: no longer a by-hand sweep. The
  refresh recognises the old workflows by content and deletes them, and
  vendor-update-runbook step 10 makes every `Update Vendors` finish the
  rest, so this runs in each repo on its next update. What follows is the
  2026-09-19 status as it stood.)* `MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md`'s step 6
  and `vendor-update-runbook.md`'s step 10 still carry the
  retired-workflow table for items 2/2a/3's file-deletion pass, and that
  hasn't run in any dependent repo yet — two of the four dependent repos
  checked still carry the named retired files
  (`light-check.yml`, `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml`, and, in one of the
  two, `platform-docs-check.yml`/`status-claims-check.yml`/
  `unified-prompt-check.yml`), unremoved. That's cosmetic, not a live
  cost, though: their triggers are already `pull_request`-with-`paths`
  or `workflow_dispatch` only, so none of them fire on an ordinary push.
  Separately, and sooner than this bullet originally expected: item 9's
  fix reached all four repos this session checked
  (`themorgan/precedent-individual`, `themorgan/precedent-team-writing`,
  and the two dependent repos above) the same day it
  shipped here, without waiting for a full migration pass — `abc667a`
  (2026-09-18) taught "Update Vendors" to refresh an already-installed CI
  workflow file against its current template, not just write it once at
  install; the two practice sets took the fix that way plus a direct
  hand-applied commit each (item 8's own account), while the two
  dependent repos got a hand-applied fix after "Update Vendors" backfilled
  a manifest baseline for a file it had never tracked before (which, by
  that commit's own design, does not rewrite content on its first run).
  Verified directly against all four repos' `.github/workflows/` on
  2026-09-19: branch-scoped `push:`, debounce as its own job, and
  `pull_request:` restored, matching this document's own item 9.
  **One bookkeeping gap found in the same check:** both dependent repos'
  hand-applied fixes left `tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`'s
  `ci_workflows_sha256` pointing at the pre-fix hash for
  `bestpractice-docs.yml`, so the next template improvement to
  `doc-lint.yml.template` would have read that file as hand-edited and
  refused to auto-refresh it there — fixed the same day via the new
  `record-ci` subcommand (item 9a below).
- **Phase C — done, exercised live, and revised (items 8-9).** A debounce
  guard (`ci_debounce_minutes`, default `360`) ships in
  `doc-lint.yml.template` and `precedent-check.yml.template` (which now
  also carries what `views-drift.yml.template` used to), and nowhere
  else — not in this repo's own three workflows, per item 2b below (item
  4). Its first real run, on four of Morgan's practice sets, showed it
  caps a run's expensive tail but not the baseline cost of the
  checkout-plus-guard steps that ran unconditionally on every trigger.
  Item 9 revised both templates to move the guard into its own job (a
  job-level skip is never billed at all, unlike a step-level one) and add
  a branch-scoped `push:` plus `pull_request:`, which is the volume fix
  the debounce guard alone was never designed to provide. Full account:
  items 8 and 9 above.
- **Phase D — held; item 10 shipped alongside it, 2026-09-20.** The
  self-hosted runner *pilot* on Morgan's own repos (item 6) is still held,
  per the todo reminder above. What shipped is a different, narrower piece:
  the `PRECEDENT_RUNNER` template variable (item 10) that lets *any*
  adopter opt a private install onto their own runner, and the
  [documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](../documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)/[templates/github-actions/README.md](../templates/github-actions/README.md)
  updates describing it — this closes the "other random people" gap item 6
  never addressed, without deciding the pilot question for Morgan's own
  repos.

## Open decisions

1. **Item 2b: keep this repo's own `docs.yml`/`deep-check.yml`/`leak-gate.yml`
   mandatory, un-gated by any of the above?** Still open — "phases 1-5"
   approved everything above, and item 2b was deliberately held out of
   every phase rather than folded into any of them, so this needs its own
   answer. Recommendation unchanged: yes, given the security rationale on
   record and that this repo is public (so nothing here is actually
   costing money).
2. **`ci_workflows` granularity** — implemented as one field gating every
   template, not per-workflow control. Revisit only if a practice set
   turns up wanting its own checks but not a consuming repo's doc lint.
3. **Debounce default window** — implemented as `360` minutes (Morgan's
   own "6 hours" example) and left there in the templates; item 8's
   incident tightened it to `30` minutes in the four repos it touched, a
   per-repo call in `identity.json`/`precedent.json`, not a template
   default change. **Resolved, item 9**: all three templates now ship
   `pull_request:` alongside `push: branches: [main]`, documented in each
   template's own header and in [templates/github-actions/README.md](../templates/github-actions/README.md) as a
   customization point for a repo whose routine merge target isn't just
   `main`. **Revised, item 11 (2026-09-20)**: default widened to `720`
   minutes in both templates, at Morgan's explicit direction, accepting
   back the staleness window item 8 had narrowed. The four repos still
   carrying item 8's hand-set `30` override are unaffected until someone
   edits their own `identity.json` directly — this session's access does
   not reach them.
4. **Which workflows are debounce-exempt** — implemented as: every
   vendored template gets it, this repo's own three workflows do not.
5. **Self-hosted runner pilot scope** — still open, deferred to items 6/7's
   todo reminder.
