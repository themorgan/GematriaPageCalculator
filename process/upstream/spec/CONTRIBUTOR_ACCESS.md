# Contributor access: who may write what, and who may land a practice

This is a self-contained implementation plan, written so a fresh session with
no memory of the conversation that produced it can carry it out. **It has not
been run against a real person or a real repository**, and three of the
platform behaviours it rests on are unverified — see "Verify these first."

## What this replaced, and when

Until 2026-09-11 this file was named `NONTECHNICAL_CONTRIBUTOR_ACCESS.md`
(here in `spec/` — the name is recorded so anyone holding the old link can
see where it went), and it drew the line in a different place: a **non-technical contributor** was
given GitHub's **Triage** or **Read** role, and a per-person session
configuration denied `git push` and `git merge`.

**That model could not do the thing the whole use case exists for.** Triage
and Read deny every write, so the contributor could not put a sentence into a
document either — and "an alternative to Google Docs, where they write and
create hand in hand with the assistant" is the point of the exercise. The plan
and the vision contradicted each other outright.

It also had no answer to a question with no answer: **how does anything
determine that a person is non-technical?** Nothing did. There was no field,
no registry, no flag — only a human picking a role at invite time and a label
that existed in people's heads.

Morgan settled it on 2026-09-11: *"The dividing line I wanted to make is
between whether they can make practices (no, only suggest them) or other
'technical' changes (update vendored files, etc)."* — `strength: decided`; he
named the line himself. **The mechanism below is this session's proposal,
which he approved by asking for the write-up** — `strength: assented`, per
[decision-strength](../practices/decision-strength.md).

## The line, in one sentence

**A contributor writes content freely; a protected path needs an owner's
review; a practice is suggested by anyone and landed only by a listed
approver.**

Nothing in that sentence describes a person's skill level, and that is the
design, not a wording choice. The old file's own failure is the argument:
once a rule is keyed to a kind of person, something has to decide who is that
kind of person, and nothing can
([technical-describes-people](../practices/technical-describes-people.md)).
Keyed to paths and to an approver list, both questions already have
machine-readable answers.

So **this plan defines no user types**, and a repository following it stores
none. Everyone gets the same three boundaries; what differs is which paths
name them as an owner and whether `approvers.json` lists them.

## The three layers

### 1. GitHub collaborator role — **Write**

The contributor is a **Write** collaborator on the project repository. They
push branches, open pull requests and merge their own content work, through
the assistant, using [Booked](../practices/go-update.md) (`Go update`) — they never need
to see git vocabulary to do it.

**Write alone restricts nothing**, which is why layer 2 is not optional. A
Write collaborator on an unprotected repository can rewrite anything in it.

**This layer binds only if the person authenticates to GitHub as themselves**,
not through a shared organisation-wide connection. Confirm that once, per
project, before relying on any of it — an assistant session riding a shared
credential is checked against that credential's rights, not the person's.

### 2. Branch protection plus CODEOWNERS — the actual boundary

Protect the base branch: require a pull request before merging, and require
review **from code owners**. Then a `CODEOWNERS` file names the maintainer as
the owner of every path a contributor should not change alone.

The intended behaviour is that a pull request touching only unowned paths —
the documents — is the contributor's to merge, while one touching an owned
path waits for the maintainer. **That behaviour is assumption 1 below and is
not verified.**

The paths to own, in a repository built from
[templates/document-project/](../templates/document-project/):

| Path | Why it is owned |
|---|---|
| `/.github/` | Workflow files are executable code holding a token. Anyone who can edit one can rewrite everything else here, so leaving this out defeats the whole arrangement. It also holds `CODEOWNERS` itself. **Owning it gates the merge, not the run** — see finding 3 in the 2026-09-14 review below. |
| `/.claude/` | Session configuration and hooks — the harness runs these. |
| `/tools/` | The vendored Precedent engine. |
| `/precedent/` | The vendored universal practice catalogue. |
| `/practices/`, `/local/` | Practice text, wherever an install materialises it. |
| `/precedent.json` | Declares the sources in force, the visibility, the base branch. |
| `/AGENTS.md`, `/CLAUDE.md` | The instructions every session loads. |

Everything not listed is content, and content is the contributor's. **The
table is a registry now** (2026-09-14): it is the `owned_paths` field of the
project's `precedent.json`, each path with its reason, and
[tools/build_codeowners.py](../tools/build_codeowners.py) generates
`.github/CODEOWNERS` from it and from the `maintainers` field beside it,
exactly as it generates a practice set's file from `approvers.json`.

**`MAP.md` and `GLOSSARY.md` are deliberately not owned.** They were, until
the 2026-09-14 review noticed that
[orientation-map](../practices/orientation-map.md) has every thread that adds
a document add its row to the map — so every add-a-document pull request
touched an owned path and waited for the maintainer, the exact bottleneck
this plan exists to avoid. In a document project those two files index
content and are content; a wrong row is a content mistake, and content is
the contributor's. Unowned on the session's recommendation, approved as part
of "build what's needed" — `strength: assented`.

**`CODEOWNERS` must own itself** (it sits under `/.github/`, which is owned),
or the boundary is one commit from being removed by whoever it binds.

### 3. Practice authority — `approvers.json`, and the machinery already exists

A practice is landed by a listed approver, and by nobody else. This half needs
no new mechanism:

- **`approvers.json`** in each practice set names them.
- **[tools/build_codeowners.py](../tools/build_codeowners.py)** generates that
  set's own `CODEOWNERS` from the list, so GitHub requires an approver's
  review on the practice text itself. One source, one generated view — never
  hand-edit the output.
- The same generator draws a **project's** boundary from `precedent.json`'s
  `maintainers` and `owned_paths` (since 2026-09-14), so a document project
  and a practice set answer "who reviews what" from one tool and one
  registry each.
- **[tools/precedent_candidate.py](../tools/precedent_candidate.py)** is how
  anyone raises a suggestion. For a contributor who is not a listed approver
  it defaults to `--as-issue true` against the relevant shared set, per
  [spec/CANDIDATE_FORMAT.md](CANDIDATE_FORMAT.md)'s rule: a quiet
  `candidates/*.md` file accomplishes nothing when nobody with landing
  authority is watching it.

**This applies to every non-approver, technical or not.** A developer who is
not listed in `approvers.json` suggests practices exactly the way a writer
does. That is the same line, drawn once.

### 4. Session configuration — user experience, not enforcement

What is left for the person's own session or environment configuration is the
part a boundary cannot do: the plain-language persona, no git or
mechanical-rule vocabulary, restate an idea before acting on it, route every
practice idea through the candidate flow above.

**`permission_mode` is still never `bypassPermissions`.** The `git push` /
`git merge` denials from the old model go away — they were standing in for a
boundary GitHub should be drawing, and they are what made the contributor
unable to write.

**None of this belongs in the repository's tracked `.claude/settings.json`.**
That file binds every session on the repository, maintainers included. The
document-project template shipped exactly that mistake and Morgan found it the
only way it could be found — by being unable to push his own work to his own
repository (2026-09-10; the story is in
[practices/technical-describes-people.md](../practices/technical-describes-people.md)).

## Verify these first — three assumptions, none confirmed

Stated as of 2026-09-11 and **read from nobody's documentation**: these are
the places this plan can fail, and each is cheap to settle before anyone
builds on it.

1. **Can "require review from Code Owners" gate owned paths while leaving a
   documents-only pull request mergeable by its author?** The whole design
   rests on this. If it does not hold, every content change needs the
   maintainer's review, and the maintainer is a bottleneck rather than a
   boundary. Settle it with one throwaway pull request of each shape.
2. **Is branch protection (or rulesets) available on the plan this private
   repository sits under?** Without it, Write is simply Write and layer 2
   does not exist.
3. **Does the person authenticate to GitHub as themselves?** Layer 1's own
   caveat. Test it, do not assume it: have them attempt something their role
   forbids and confirm GitHub rejects it under their identity.

## Instantiating this

1. Create the repository and install the loader —
   [templates/document-project/README.md](../templates/document-project/README.md)
   steps 1-4, unchanged.
2. Settle the three assumptions above.
3. Add the person as a **Write** collaborator (GitHub UI: Settings →
   Collaborators and teams → Add people). No tool in this repository's GitHub
   toolset creates a collaborator invite — this stays a human step.
4. Turn on branch protection for the base branch: require a pull request,
   require code-owner review, and do not allow bypassing for people who are
   not administrators. Then run
   `python3 tools/precedent_boundary_check.py` with a token that can read
   the repository's settings: it says PASS, FAIL with the setting that is
   wrong, or UNVERIFIED, and only PASS means the boundary is on.
5. Fill in `maintainers` in `precedent.json` and run
   `python3 tools/build_codeowners.py`; commit the generated
   `.github/CODEOWNERS` with it. Never hand-edit the generated file.
6. Configure the person's own session or environment with layer 4's persona.
   Nothing in it denies a git command any more.

## Verify by postcondition, not by report

Per [verify-postcondition](../practices/verify-postcondition.md) — name the
state, then test it independently of what any command printed.

- **"They can land a document change on their own."** They open and merge a
  documents-only pull request end to end, without the maintainer touching it.
- **"They cannot land a change to a protected path."** They open a pull
  request editing `precedent.json`, and GitHub — not the assistant's
  reluctance — blocks the merge until the owner reviews.
- **"A workflow file is protected."** The same test against
  `.github/workflows/`, which is the path that makes every other one
  meaningless if it is missed.
- **"A practice idea becomes a real, visible candidate."** They describe an
  observation in plain language, and an Issue appears on the shared set where an
  approver will see it, with no mechanical-rule vocabulary in their
  conversation.
- **"The boundary survives them."** They cannot edit `.github/CODEOWNERS`
  without an owner's review.

## Review, 2026-09-14 — what the plan still lacks

Morgan asked, 2026-09-14, whether anything about contributors with limited
technical ability still needed building, and how such people should be
defined, managed, limited and controlled. This section is that session's
answer, written up on his instruction — `strength: assented`, per
[decision-strength](../practices/decision-strength.md): the framing and the
findings were the session's, and he approved the write-up without choosing
among them. Nothing here was run against a real person or repository
either; that is finding 7.

### Define, manage, limit, control — the four answers

- **Define by list, never by label.** Three roles, each one a file or a
  GitHub setting: a **collaborator** (invited, Write), a **maintainer**
  (named in `CODEOWNERS`), an **approver** (named in `approvers.json`).
  Nobody is stored as technical or non-technical anywhere. The one place a
  skill level legitimately lives is the person's own `register` field in
  their `identity.json`, self-declared, which the shared-level
  `default-register` practice already reads. That field was absent from
  the individual-set template until this review, so a person bootstrapped
  before 2026-09-14 fell to the non-technical default without ever being
  asked; the skeleton carries `{{PERSON_REGISTER}}` now and
  `precedent_bootstrap_source.py --verify` names the key when a set has
  none.
- **Manage from one registry.** A practice set generates its `CODEOWNERS`
  from `approvers.json`. The document project hand-wrote its own. That was
  two mechanisms for one question, and the hand-written one is the one a
  maintainer forgets to update. **Built the same day**: a `maintainers` field
  and an `owned_paths` field in the project's `precedent.json`, and
  [tools/build_codeowners.py](../tools/build_codeowners.py) generating the
  project file from them, as it does the set's
  ([registry-source-of-truth](../practices/registry-source-of-truth.md)).
  Onboarding is one invite plus one line.
- **Limit at GitHub, not in the session.** Paths and lists at the platform,
  persona in the session, no deny lists. Unchanged from the layers above.
- **Control by checks and a rehearsal.** A mechanical check that the
  boundary is actually on, a session-side warning before a pull request
  crosses it, and one real pilot. Findings 5, 6 and 7.

### Seven findings, ranked

1. **The three assumptions above are still the biggest risk, and one of
   them may sink the design.** As of 2026-09-14, read from nobody's
   documentation: the session's understanding is that GitHub's branch
   protection on a *private* repository owned by a personal account is a
   paid-plan feature, and that the documents-only-mergeable behaviour needs
   the required-approvals count set to zero alongside "require review from
   code owners". Both are one throwaway repository away from settled.
   Morgan opened that repository the same day, a throwaway under his own
   account, and this session could not attach it
   (`add_repo` refuses a cross-owner add) or read GitHub's documentation
   (blocked by the network proxy), so the measurement is seeded into
   [a session rooted there](https://claude.ai/code/session_01DqP5TjkampkhpW3DEvVi7Z),
   which writes its answers to a `RESULTS.md` in that repository. The
   "Verify these first" section above closes against that file, not
   against this paragraph.
2. **[MAP.md](../templates/MAP.md.template) is an owned path, and
   [orientation-map](../practices/orientation-map.md) says every thread that
   adds a document adds its row.** So every "write me a new document" pull
   request touches an owned file and waits for the maintainer — the exact
   bottleneck this plan exists to avoid. Two ways out: unown the map and
   [the glossary](../templates/GLOSSARY.md.template) in the document-project `CODEOWNERS`, since in a document
   project they index content and are content; or regenerate them in
   continuous integration after merge, so no contributor commit ever
   touches them.
   **Unowned, same day** — the first way out, on the session's
   recommendation under "build what's needed" (`strength: assented`); the
   layer-2 section above records why.
3. **`CODEOWNERS` gates the merge, not the run.** A Write collaborator who
   edits a workflow file on their own branch gets that workflow executed on
   push, with whatever the repository's secrets are, before any review
   happens — as the session understands GitHub's behaviour for same-repository
   branches, as of 2026-09-14, unverified. Owning `/.github/` stops the
   change from landing; it does not stop it from running once. The
   mitigation is policy rather than protection: a document project's
   workflows carry no secret beyond the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, with the
   workflow's `permissions` block read-only, so a rewritten workflow has
   nothing to take. The templates under
   [templates/github-actions/](../templates/github-actions/) and this
   repository's own three workflows all declare `permissions: contents:
   read` — audited 2026-09-14, all six read-only — and the document-project
   README now says to keep it that way. What stays unverified is the run
   behaviour itself, which needs GitHub's documentation or the throwaway
   repository.
4. **The reader-facing documents contradict this plan.**
   [documentation/FOR_EVERYONE_ELSE.md](../documentation/FOR_EVERYONE_ELSE.md)'s
   "What You Can't Do (on Purpose)" and
   [templates/GETTING_STARTED.md](../templates/GETTING_STARTED.md)'s step 5
   both still say the contributor proposes and an administrator merges. This
   plan says they merge their own documents. **Reworded the same day** to
   say what the plan says — content is theirs to merge, the machinery and
   the rules are not — since a document describing the design should
   describe this one; if finding 1 sinks the design, both documents change
   again with it.
5. **Nothing checks that the boundary is on.** A forgotten instantiation
   step 6 turns Write into unrestricted write, silently, and every document
   here goes on describing a boundary that does not exist. The check is the
   same shape as [tools/precedent_source_names.py](../tools/precedent_source_names.py):
   ask the GitHub API whether the base branch requires a pull request and a
   code-owner review, print `UNVERIFIED` rather than a pass when offline.
   **Built the same day**:
   [tools/precedent_boundary_check.py](../tools/precedent_boundary_check.py),
   with the API stubbed in the harness so every verdict asserts its own
   words. It needs a token with administration read; the session's own
   token gets a 403 and the tool says UNVERIFIED, which is the point.
6. **The session should say, before opening a pull request, when a change
   will wait for review.** Diff the touched paths against `CODEOWNERS` and
   tell the contributor in plain words — *"this touches the project's
   settings, so Alex has to look at it before it lands; want me to split the
   document part out so that goes in now?"* It is user experience, not
   enforcement, and it removes the "worse error" case
   [TODO.md](../TODO.md)'s `review-skill-level-permissions` item names.
   **Built the same day**:
   [tools/precedent_owned_paths.py](../tools/precedent_owned_paths.py)
   prints the owned and free paths and the sentence to say, and the
   document-project `AGENTS.md` runs it before every pull request. The
   hooks' own refusals are the other half of the same problem: the freshness
   guard and the gates print exit codes and git vocabulary, which
   [fail-gracefully](../practices/fail-gracefully.md) says a non-technical
   reader must never be handed raw, and nothing translates them yet.
7. **The pilot is the test, and it still does not exist.** The cheapest
   version is Morgan himself as the contributor, from a second GitHub
   account, following [FOR_EVERYONE_ELSE.md](../documentation/FOR_EVERYONE_ELSE.md) literally — the way pass 1 of
   [VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md) rehearsed the install as the
   person it was written for. Every line of "Verify by postcondition" above
   is a one-sentence check there.

**Where this is documented for the people who will meet it** (2026-09-14):
[INSTALL.md §0](../INSTALL.md#0-installing-directly-onto-the-precedent-loader)'s
step 10 is the install step; [FOR_DEVELOPERS.md](../documentation/FOR_DEVELOPERS.md)'s
"Who May Change What" is the technical summary;
[FOR_EVERYONE_ELSE.md](../documentation/FOR_EVERYONE_ELSE.md)'s "What You
Can't Do (on Purpose)" is the contributor's version;
[documentation/GITHUB_SETTINGS.md](../documentation/GITHUB_SETTINGS.md) is
the GitHub side — roles, branch protection, what CODEOWNERS does and how it
is generated here, Actions permissions — in one place; and the very deep
check's `CONTRIBUTOR BOUNDARY` section reads the setting on every run.

## What this does not cover

- **A guard inside the session that knows who is running.** Precedent already
  resolves a person at runtime — `PRECEDENT_COMMIT_NAME`/`_EMAIL`, the ladder
  in [tools/precedent_time.py](../tools/precedent_time.py), the individual
  source — so a tracked hook could warn when somebody outside `approvers.json`
  edits a protected path, closing the "a manual step can be forgotten" gap
  that [TODO.md](../TODO.md)'s `review-skill-level-permissions` item names.
  It would be a guardrail and not a boundary: an environment variable is
  self-declared. Not built, and not decided.
- **Who may become an approver.** Unchanged: adding one is itself a change to
  the practice set, needing a current approver's agreement.
- **Non-GitHub hosts** ([TODO.md](../TODO.md) item 8). Layer 2 is GitHub's
  CODEOWNERS specifically; the idea generalises, the file does not.
- **A second shared source for the same subject area**, which is a resolution
  question, not an access one.
