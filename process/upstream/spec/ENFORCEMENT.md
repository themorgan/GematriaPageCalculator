# The Enforced Channel (Phase 4)

What [PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md)'s
"[How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md#how-an-agent-knows-which-practices-to-load)"
calls the fourth loading channel:

> **Enforced.** Practices with `checked_by` are never loaded at all. The
> check's failure message *is* the rule, delivered at the moment of
> violation.

Read the plan section first; this is the implementation note. It also records
the thing phase 4 found before it converted anything, which changed what the
phase was for.

## What phase 4 found before it built anything

Phase 4's starting premise, inherited from the phase-2 measurement, was that
the most-missed practices carried `checked_by: null` and needed converting.
Eight practices already carried one. The first thing phase 4 did was run each
of those four named scripts and watch what happened. **Seven of the eight were
not enforcement at all, and the eighth enforced half of its rule. None of the
eight had ever been watched fire.**

| practice | claimed | what running it showed |
|---|---|---|
| `readers-vocabulary` | [tools/doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py) | doc_lint has no vocabulary check in it, at all. |
| `acronyms-glossary` | [tools/doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py) | the acronym check is a **warning**. doc_lint exits 0 on every one it reports. |
| `computed-numbers-in-scripts`, `docs-track-models` | [tools/doc_sync.py](../tools/doc_sync.py) | red on this repository — it read the literal `<!--gen:NAME-->` in two documentation examples as live orphan blocks. |
| `scrub-gate`, `practice-export-loop` | [tools/practice_audit.py](../tools/practice_audit.py) | red on this repository — no `process/manifest*.json`, which is correct for the upstream repo and was reported as `FAIL`. |
| `scripts-assert-properties` | [tools/model_audit.py](../tools/model_audit.py) | `OK: 0 instrumented script(s)` — a clean bill of health from a scan with an empty input set. |
| `doc-references-are-links` | [tools/doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py) | the one that held. Its strikethrough half gates; its links half warns. |

The harness could not have caught any of this. Its only check on a
`checked_by` was `check_checked_by_targets_exist` — that the named **file** is
present. So "8 of 52 enforced" was never eight. It was eight claims: two false,
four naming gates that had been red long enough that nobody ran them, one
naming a scan of nothing, and one — `doc-references-are-links` — that really
does gate, on the tilde half of its rule, with the links half a warning. Call
the honest starting figure **one of 52, partially, and untested**.

**That is the same failure class as everything else this project keeps
finding**, one level up: a check written against the same assumption as the
thing it checks. Here the assumption was that naming a script is the same as
being checked by it.

## What is here

| Plan's requirement | Built as | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Practices with `checked_by` are enforced | [tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py) — one registry entry per enforced practice | Built. `--list`, `--only SLUG`, `--paths`, `--range`, `--turn-end`, `--all`, `--strict`. |
| The check's failure message **is** the rule | `rule_of()` reads the practice's own `## Rule` through `split_practices._read_practice_file` | Built. The same reader [tools/precedent_show.py](../tools/precedent_show.py) uses, per "one code path" — a paraphrase in the check would be a second copy of the rule with nothing holding the two together. |
| Each converted practice has a test proving its check fires | `check_precedent_check_fires` in [tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py) | Built. At least one stated case per registered check, against throwaway repositories. |
| A check that cannot run says so | `NotApplicable`, reported as SKIPPED | Built. See below — this is the part that had been getting silently wrong. |
| Coverage materially above 8 of 52 | The registry | Built, and the eight it started from were re-established rather than assumed. |

<!--gen:enforcement-->
| practice | scope | what the check asserts |
|---|---|---|
| `acronyms-glossary` | change | a changed document does not introduce a NEW unglossed acronym -- one not already in GLOSSARY.md and not expanded on first use |
| `catalogue-carries-stories` | tree | every status: active practice in this catalogue carries a non-empty ## Story |
| `change-updates-its-docs` | tree | no live document names a path this repository once had and has since deleted or renamed away |
| `ci-commits-carry-identity` | tree | a .github/workflows/*.yml that runs `git commit` resolves the author from a declared identity (an identity.json, or an explicit PRECEDENT_COMMIT_*) rather than naming the github-actions bot or configuring a git identity from nothing |
| `ci-workflow-approved` | tree | every .github/workflows/*.yml or *.yaml file is either the engine's own copy, untouched since the manifest recorded it, or carries the person's approval in precedent.json's github_ci_approved, pinned to its exact content by sha256 -- so adding a workflow, or editing one (a new trigger, a new job), fails until the person approves the new content in their own words. In a consuming repo the finding sends the session to Update Vendors, which writes the shipped workflows from their templates and removes any other nobody approved, rather than to the person |
| `cite-the-incident` | change | a practice file whose Rule is new or changed must carry a non-empty ## Story |
| `code-cites-practice` | tree | a `practice: SLUG` citation in tools/**/*.py names a real, active practice -- never a typo, a deleted file, one since retired, or a position number instead of a slug |
| `computed-numbers-in-scripts` | tree | every generated block in a document matches what its script emits, is registered, and its document names the scripts that feed it |
| `dated-list-runs-forward` | tree | every list marked `<!--dated-list-->` runs oldest first, and no entry after the first dated one is missing a date of its own |
| `decision-strength` | tree | every `strength:` in a practice file or a decision record holds one of the two defined words, and the file it sits in also records who approved the thing; and every `**Strength:` line in prose records the date it was set and who set it |
| `decommission-deletes-files` | tree | every path this repo declared decommissioned is still absent, and every decommissioning carries the reason it happened |
| `deliverables-look-like-output` | change | a reader-facing document in scope carries no process residue — no verify-later flag, claims-to-source apparatus or decision provenance |
| `doc-references-are-links` | change | a changed document must not render an accidental strikethrough span — use the approximately sign, never a tilde |
| `docs-are-current-state` | change | a changed document does not carry an in-document revision annotation -- an "(added <date>)" / "(rewritten <date>)" tag, or a "Rev N" heading ladder -- since version control already carries that losslessly |
| `docs-track-models` | tree | a figure a script declares it owns is not hand-typed into the prose around its generated block |
| `document-status-header` | tree | every document under spec/ and record/ that CARRIES a lifecycle frontmatter header declares a legal kind/status pair, a title matching its own first heading, a `closed:` date exactly when it is closed, a `superseded_by:` that resolves exactly when it is superseded, and no competing hand-maintained `Last updated:` comment |
| `engine-plus-host-shims` | tree | no file outside the vendored tree duplicates a run of lines from inside it — that is a fork, not a shim |
| `environment-gotchas` | tree | the session instructions point at a gotcha catalogue and every live entry in it carries what failed, not only the fix — reading gotchas/*.md directly where a repo has migrated to that shape (and then refusing an index of it -- two or more list or table lines each linking one trap -- in AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md), or following the link into the record on the pre-migration shape |
| `filename-separator` | tree | files of the same kind in one directory use one word separator, never both - and _ |
| `generated-artifact-provenance` | tree | every generated view names the script that builds it and says it is generated, and regenerating it changes nothing |
| `generated-edit-goes-upstream` | tree | every `do not hand-edit` header also names a Source -- where the file's content actually comes from -- and every path an unqualified `Source:` names exists here. A `Source (in <place>):` names somewhere this repo is not, so its paths are reported COULD NOT VERIFY rather than resolved |
| `github-api-budget` | tree | every tool that builds a GitHub API URL is routed through tools/github_budget.py or declared in tools/github_api_budgets.json with a reason, the registry declares a core floor and a budget per tool that still exists, and nothing has quietly gone back to reading /rate_limit |
| `github-setup-disclosed` | change | a newly added GitHub Actions workflow file is named in GETTING_STARTED.md's administrator section -- the document a dependent repo's own people read -- or in a repo's own root GITHUB_ACTIONS.md, or in documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md |
| `heading-outline` | change | a changed document never jumps a heading level -- no heading is more than one level deeper than the one before it |
| `headline-capitalization` | change | a changed outward-facing document has every heading in New York Times headline capitalization |
| `index-remembers-past` | change | a changed document does not carry inline lineage language naming what it replaced or what replaced it, since provenance belongs in the repository index, not annotated into the documents themselves |
| `label-describes-content` | change | a heading or bold lead-in that claims "one line" / "one-liner" / "TL;DR" / "one paragraph" / "one-pager" must match the length of what actually follows it |
| `layered-practice-packs` | tree | every practice in force in this repo is reachable by at least one loading channel here -- resident, occasion index, a path trigger, a gate, or a running check |
| `migration-scrubs-vocabulary` | tree | a migrated repo carries no leftover pre-migration practice pack (process/manifest_*.json and its tree) |
| `new-hook-joins-the-registry` | tree | every hook script this repo ships (templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/*.sh) is on a repo kind's list in precedent_vendor_engine.py's HOOK_WIRING, or in HOOKS_NO_KIND with the reason no kind gets it; nothing is listed that is not shipped; and each kind's template -- the consumer settings.json and the set payload precedent_bootstrap_source.py writes -- wires exactly its list |
| `no-rewrite-for-warnings` | turn-end | the commit this branch was last published at is still an ancestor of its tip — published history has not been rewritten |
| `no-version-suffix` | change | a file added by this change must not end its name in a version or date token (unless it sits beside the unsuffixed predecessor it must coexist with), nor in a state word -- final, draft, copy, new, old, latest, backup -- beside the unsuffixed original it forks |
| `open-item-disposition` | tree | every `**Disposition:` line in a TODO file names one of the three dispositions, and a `parked` or `ask` line records the date it was set and who set it; and every OPEN todo/todo-*.md item's frontmatter `disposition:` is one of the three, or null |
| `orientation-map` | tree | MAP.md exists at the repository root, is not empty, and the session instructions point at it |
| `parallel-artifact-ledger` | tree | `templates/harness/LEDGER.md` exists, and every commit that touched a harness-adapter member (claude-code/, codex/, or gemini-cli/) is named in exactly one row's `Originating change` cell, or added its own row in the same commit (a commit cannot name its own ID) -- a mention in another row's prose is a citation, not that commit's own row |
| `practice-carries-its-files` | tree | every file a practice this repository PUBLISHES depends on is where a consumer will find it: each `ships:` entry is a legal path that exists here; each concrete (non-glob) `applies_to` path under tools/ and the `checked_by` script exist here; and every tools/ file outside tools/checks/ that the practice's shipped test reads through its root is either a vendored engine file or declared in `ships:` by a practice here |
| `practice-change-propagates` | tree | no file this repository owns carries a LIVE pointer to a practice in force nowhere, or one that now only forwards to a different slug -- a markdown link to its file or a `precedent_show.py SLUG` command, anywhere outside history, or any mention of it inside an in-force practice's own `## Rule` -- and no practice file this repository publishes was deleted or renamed away on this branch (retire it in place, so its withdrawn name stays readable) |
| `practice-export-loop` | tree | every manifest entry marked synced still matches its baseline — a local improvement to a vendored file has been exported, not absorbed |
| `practice-links-travel` | tree | every link in a practice file THIS repo publishes either travels with the file (a sibling practice, a vendored engine file, this source's own tools/checks/ check script or tests/ test, or a file a practice here declares in `ships:` -- each of which must exist here) or is an absolute URL into this repository on its declared base_branch, naming a path that exists. A sibling link from an ACTIVE practice must also point at one that is in force: a withdrawn practice is not materialized, so a link to one resolves here and nowhere else -- unless its `in_force_at:` names its own slug, which is the deduplication case and still travels, because another source carries that slug and resolves to the same filename |
| `quick-index` | tree | the session instructions carry a "looking for X → go to Y" table with at least five rows |
| `rename-updates-links` | tree | no tracked file still references a path this branch renamed away or deleted |
| `routing-audit` | tree | tools/routing_audit.py exists, and tools/routing_audit_state.json (if present) has no rotation entry for a practice that is not currently active |
| `scripts-assert-properties` | tree | every instrumented script asserts its own properties, and every figure it recites from a source document still matches that document |
| `scrub-gate` | tree | every text file in a vendored tree destined for another repo is clean against that tree's blocklist, at all times |
| `search-by-purpose` | change | a document carrying generated numbers is reachable from an index a reader actually consults |
| `session-bootstrap` | tree | if the session instructions name a setup command, a session-start hook must run it |
| `session-load-budget` | tree | every file a session loads before it works is declared in tools/session_load_budgets.json and is under its declared ceiling, a repo that declares ceilings also declares headroom_floor_pct so the early-warning notice is not silently off, and a change does not add text the practice catalogue already holds |
| `source-naming` | tree | every precedent.json in the tree names each source by a name its level allows -- `precedent` and `local` for universal and repo-local, a slug for a shared or individual set -- and every declared source on disk that carries a precedent-source.json answers to the name and level declared for it |
| `speculation-is-marked` | tree | a speculative document under spec/ or record/ carries all four of its markers or none of them: the SPECULATIVE_ filename prefix requires a matching title, `kind: proposal`, a drafted/abandoned status and a warning block directly under the heading -- and, in the other direction, a document whose title or opening paragraph calls itself speculative must carry the prefix |
| `technical-describes-people` | tree | no tracked path labels a FILE or DIRECTORY with a skill level; 'technical' and 'non-technical' describe people |
| `timestamps-carry-offset` | tree | no tracked Python file stamps a moment with a bare `date.today()`, `utcnow()`, `utcfromtimestamp()` or a zero-argument `datetime.now()` -- every one of those resolves to whatever zone the machine is on, which in a container is UTC and in a record is unrecoverable. And the ENGINE's fallback zone is the SAME string in all three engine files that hold it: the time engine and both copies of the commit hook |
| `todo-migrate-available-but-unused` | tree | a repo that has tools/todo_migrate.py vendored in (source or consumer engine alike) but has never run it -- TODO.md still carries real old-format item bullets, no todo/ directory exists, and the file does not open on the "# TODO has moved" stub heading |
| `two-check-levels` | tree | the session instructions name both of the repo's two check levels -- the pair GLOSSARY.md defines against this practice, or "light check" / "deep check" where the glossary defines none -- and the glossary, when it names any, names two distinct levels |
| `upstream-fix` | tree | every exemption-list entry in precedent.json that is new against the base branch carries a root_fix: what was fixed instead, or why the check cannot learn the case |
| `verify-postcondition` | turn-end | the state you wanted after the operations this turn: nothing committed but unpushed on any local branch, and no tracked file left modified |
| `workflow-file-outside-vendoring` | tree | every .github/workflows/*.yml or *.yaml file that changed is either the one file this repo's kind vendors through precedent_vendor_engine.py, or already a known RETIRED_CI_WORKFLOW_FILES entry -- anything else is named, once, as worth a second look |

56 of 176 practices are enforced. Run `python3 tools/precedent_check.py --explain` for what each check does **not** catch.

## A skip is not a pass

Every graceful-failure path here ends in `SKIPPED` with a reason, and the
summary line says so in those words:

```
precedent_check: N passed, 0 violated, 0 advisory, 0 errored, M skipped, 0 exempted, K could not be verified (a skip is not a pass, and neither is a could-not-verify; advisory findings do not fail the run; an exemption is this repo declaring the rule does not bind it, with a reason, in precedent.json).
```

(0 violated is what matters here — the passed/skipped counts grow as
checks are added or as more of a clean tree happens to be in scope for a
`change`-only check, so a literal N/M pinned into this example goes stale
by design; this document had one and a 2026-09-01 deep-check audit found
it already wrong. `errored` is a fourth, later-added status, 2026-09-03:
a check that raised something other than `NotApplicable` — its own bug
hitting an edge case it didn't validate for, not a real-or-clean verdict
either way — fails the run exactly as a violation does, rather than
taking every other check in the same run down with it as an uncaught
exception used to. `advisory`, a fifth status, 2026-09-05: not a general
severity dial — `check()`'s own `advisory` parameter is reserved for a
specific, dated, documented incident, currently only
`parallel-artifact-ledger` (see its own comment in
[tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py) and
[TODO.md](../TODO.md)'s tracking item). An advisory finding still prints
in full; it just doesn't fail the run. `could not be verified`, added
2026-09-12, is the only one of these that is not a whole-check status:
a check that PASSED can still have looked at something it could not
resolve, and the two are reported side by side. It exists because a
check's subject can live outside the repository it runs in — a generated
file mirrored in from the repo that builds it names a source no clone
here contains, and calling that a violation blames a correct header while
calling it a pass claims a verification that never happened. It prints
per item, every run, under `COULD NOT VERIFY`, and does not fail the run;
`--strict` fails on it, alongside a skipped check.)

This is not fastidiousness. Three of the four inherited scripts were failing
in one of the two ways a check can fail without failing. Two exited non-zero
for a reason that had nothing to do with the practices claiming them —
[tools/practice_audit.py](../tools/practice_audit.py) because a precondition
was absent (no `process/` directory in a repo that vendors nothing),
[tools/doc_sync.py](../tools/doc_sync.py) because it read a documentation
example as a live block. The third exited **zero** on an empty input list. The
first kind gets ignored until nobody runs it; the second kind gets believed.
All three were fixed at the source rather than worked around, so the
underlying tools now report NOT APPLICABLE with the reason, and
`precedent_check` passes that through as a skip.

Checks that describe the boundary between a vendored upstream and its host
can skip here as a permanent and correct condition, because this repo **is**
the upstream: as of 2026-09-28 that is `engine-plus-host-shims`
(`scrub-gate` and `practice-export-loop` skipped here when this was
written, and run now). Their firing tests build the vendored tree in a fixture, so the
checks are verified even though this tree cannot exercise them.

## A check can bind the repo that PUBLISHES a practice

Every practice-backed check is gated on `practices/<slug>.md` being present in
the repo it runs in. That is right for a **consuming** repo: a finding whose
Rule the reader cannot even print is a finding nobody can act on, and before
the gate existed a fresh install reported a violation for this repo's own
repo-local branch rule.

**A practice SOURCE set is the case that gate gets wrong.** Its `practices/`
holds its own practices only; it resolves no sources and materializes nothing
into itself, so every other level's check skipped there — permanently, not
pending configuration. Measured 2026-09-12 in a shared source: **12 passed, 42
skipped, and all 42 skips that one cause.** The repositories that publish the
catalogue were the least-checked repositories in the system.

It had already cost something. A practice file in that set shipped a relative
link to a test driver that materialization deliberately does not copy — live in
the publishing set, dead in every repository that received the catalogue. The
rule that catches exactly that, `practice-links-travel`, was one of the 42, so
a **consuming** repo found it a sync late.

`binds_publishers=True` on a check's registration is the answer: the check runs
in a repo that publishes a `practices/` tree even where that practice's own
text is not vendored in. Two things make it safe:

- **Publisher-ness is declared, not detected.** It reads `kind: source` from
  `tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`, which `precedent_vendor_engine.py` writes and
  reads back for its own verbs. An authored `practices/` tree and a
  materialized one look identical on disk, which is why the kind is declared.
- **The failure message is still the rule.** It cannot print a Rule that is not
  there, so it prints where the Rule *is* — the `blob` URL on the branch the
  manifest records the engine was vendored from. Printing
  `(no practice file for ...)` instead would be this module's whole design
  quietly failing at the one moment it is load-bearing.

Three checks carry the flag, each with its own incident recorded beside it:
`practice-links-travel`, `catalogue-carries-stories` and
`generated-artifact-provenance`. **Widening it is per-check judgment, not a
sweep** — the flag removes the gate, it does not make a check that needs
resolved sources work without them — and the remaining skips in a source set
are what [`coverage-report-for-registered-checks`](../todo/todo-2026-09-12-coverage-report-for-registered-checks.md)
is for. `verify_harness.py`'s
`check_publisher_bound_checks_run_in_a_source_set` asserts both directions
against a fixture that plants the link which really shipped: a publisher fails
on it and names where the Rule lives, and a consumer with the same planted link
still skips.

### "The check ran" is not "the practice is in force"

That gate reads **file presence, and nothing inside the file**. `run()`'s
condition is `_practice_file(slug) is None`, so:

| | what it actually means |
|---|---|
| **the check ran** | a `practices/<slug>.md` exists — **at any `status`** — or the check carries `binds_publishers` and this repo publishes practices |
| **the practice is in force** | the file exists **and** its `status` is in force |

A practice at `status: deduplicated` or `retired` is not in force and is
excluded from every generated view, and **its check still runs.**

**Left that way deliberately, decided 2026-09-13.** Enforcing a withdrawn
practice is harmless: `deduplicated` means the rule is fully in force one
level up, `retired` is rare and loud, and in neither case does running the
check make something wrong happen. `binds_publishers` covers the cases that
raised the question. Reading `status` instead would change behaviour in every
consuming repo at once, and `rule_of()` needs the file present to print
anything at all.

**The consequence that costs something**, and the reason this is written down
rather than shrugged at: **a session verifying that a local re-declaration is
no longer load-bearing cannot do it by deduplicating the file and watching the
check still pass.** File presence alone produces that result, so the weak test
"confirms" the removal while proving nothing. **The decisive test is removing
the file entirely.** That is how a shared set's re-declared
`catalogue-carries-stories` copy was verified on 2026-09-13, and the weaker
test would have passed just as readily on a copy that was still the only thing
switching the check on.

## Scopes, because a practice is not always a property of a file

- **`tree`** — a property of the repository as it stands. An index exists; the
  generated views are current; the gotchas section carries stories. Always
  runs.
- **`change`** — a property of what a change adds or edits. A new practice
  carries its incident; an added file is not named for its version. Runs
  against the files in scope (changed vs. `HEAD` by default, `--paths` or
  `--range` to say otherwise).
- **`turn-end`** — the state you wanted *after* an operation. Nothing
  committed but unpushed; published history not rewritten. **Excluded from the
  default run**, because mid-work an unpushed commit is not a violation. This
  is where a Stop hook calls it.

The third scope exists because `verify-postcondition` and
`no-rewrite-for-warnings` are not properties of a diff at all, and forcing
them into the default run would have made the gate red during ordinary work —
which is how a gate stops being run.

## How each check was established not to be a test that passes on a bug

Two directions per practice, and then a mutation of the whole registry.

**Both directions.** `check_precedent_check_fires` copies this tree into a
scratch repository, plants the violation the practice exists to prevent, and
requires a non-zero exit — and then requires the *same tree unplanted* to come
back clean. The second half is not ceremony. The first version of the
`quick-index` check counted table rows from the end of its regex match, which
is the middle of the header line, and so reported **zero rows** on a table
with thirty-two. It would have fired on the planted violation perfectly. What
caught it was running the check against this repository and reading what it
said — which is exactly the property the clean direction now asserts on every
harness run. The same thing happened again later, on `no-version-suffix`,
which reported this session's own preserved eval baseline as a versioned
file name.

**The whole registry, neutered.** Every check was then replaced with one that
returns no findings, and the harness re-run. It named all eighteen. A check
that has stopped looking now fails a check.

**One check was rewritten because it fired on correct work.** The first
`environment-gotchas` check looked for failure *words* — failed, broke,
silently, cost — and reported a genuine story told in other words ("a smoke
test believed it was exercising a shallow clone for an hour and was not") as a
bare fix. A check that fires on correct work gets switched off, and is then
absent when an entry really is a bare command. It now tests structure
(an entry that is one short sentence is a bare fix) and says plainly, in
`--explain`, that padding defeats it.

## Every check carries what it does not catch

`python3 tools/precedent_check.py --explain` prints, for each practice, what
the check asserts **and what it is blind to**. That belongs beside the check
rather than in a document that drifts from it, and it is the honest answer to
the question an enforced practice invites: if this is checked, is the prose
redundant? For most of these, no:

- `environment-gotchas`' check guards the *artifact* — the section exists,
  the entries carry stories. It cannot see a discovery that was never written
  down, which is the failure the practice is actually about.
- `verify-postcondition`'s check asserts two named postconditions for this
  repository at turn end. The Rule's instruction — *name the postcondition
  before you run the command* — governs every state-changing operation, almost
  none of which any check knows about.

**So the plan's phase-4 instruction to "drop their prose from the resident
tier" was not followed for these two, and the reason is worth recording rather
than quietly skipping:** that instruction assumes a check is coextensive with
its rule. Where it nearly is — `quick-index` asks for a table in the
instructions file, and the check asserts one is there with rows in it, though
not that they are the right rows — dropping the prose costs little. Where it is not, dropping the prose
trades a preventive channel for a detective one that cannot detect the case in
question. Four of the six resident practices carried a check when this was
written, and all six stayed resident (2026-09-28: four of ten).

## What the routing eval says, and what it cannot

See [spec/LOADER.md](LOADER.md)'s v4 section for the numbers. The important
structural point belongs here, because it is about enforcement rather than
about the loader:

**Phase 4's done-when — "the routing eval re-run shows the converted practices
no longer missed" — is not, read literally, something conversion can deliver**,
and the plan says so itself two sections earlier: an enforced practice is
"never loaded at all". A practice with a working check is deliberately absent
from the routing question. The arm that routes will keep missing it, and
should.

So `python3 tools/routing_eval.py --enforcement` reports the miss set by
**what now covers it** instead, which is the question the done-when was
reaching for. Its own output states the limit, and so does this: a check being
in scope means the violation would be *caught* if the change committed one. It
does not mean these particular commits violated anything — most did not — and
it is not evidence that a session complied. **Coverage, not compliance.**

## Reach and enforcement are two problems

Phase 3's brief flagged this and phase 4 confirmed it from both ends.

`practice-export-loop` was the largest single miss in the v3 run, 8 of 10,
while carrying both a `checked_by` and a narrow `applies_to`. Its glob was
`process/upstream/**` — where an export **lands**, which is the one place a
change cannot have touched *before* the export gate is supposed to fire. The
practice's own occasion is a thread that improved a generic practice, and in
this repository generic practices live in [PRACTICES.md](../PRACTICES.md),
[practices/](../practices), [templates/](../templates) and
[tools/](../tools). The glob now names those. That is a correction to a scope
statement, not a tuning of the index — the plan's
[What NOT to do with this result](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md#what-not-to-do-with-this-result)
forbids the second, and names "a narrower glob" as exactly what a
repeatedly-unrouted practice should get.

**A dependent repo may need to narrow this again.** `templates/**` and
`tools/**` are where *this* repo keeps practice text; in a host repo they are
the host's own files. That is what a source at a lower level overriding a
universal practice is for.

The result, and the reason to state reach and enforcement separately: the
misses on that practice halved, and **every one that remains is a case where
the path channel surfaced it and the session declined it anyway.** Reach was a
real problem and is now fixed for this practice. What is left is not a reach
problem.

## A materialized check cannot carry per-repo data

Found 2026-09-07, from a real consumer install rather than from reading.
[precedent_materialize.py](../tools/precedent_materialize.py) copies each
source's `tools/checks/check_*.py`
byte-identically into the consuming repo's own `tools/checks/`, and deletes
and rewrites that whole directory on every
[precedent_sync_views.py](../tools/precedent_sync_views.py) run. Two
consequences follow, and only the first is already written down (in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)'s gotchas): a check script hand-added there
survives until the next sync, so it belongs under its source's own declared
`path`.

The second is about the script's *contents*, and is easy to miss because the
file is in the right place and the check works. **A check that keeps
repo-specific data as a constant in the script can never be extended by the
repo it runs in.** The consumer cannot edit the materialized copy — it is
overwritten. Editing the source instead means putting one consumer's data
into a shared or individual set that several repos share, which is worse. The
data has nowhere correct to live.

The case that surfaced it: `check_commit_author.py` and
`check_buenos_aires_dates.py` in `precedent-individual` both held a
`GRANDFATHERED_SHAS` constant listing commits exempt from the rule. Those
SHAs are `precedent-individual`'s own history. A consuming repo with its own
pre-mechanism commits to grandfather had no way to say so — the exemption
existed, and was unreachable from the only place that needed it. The fix was
to move the list into a per-repo `identity.json` the checks read at runtime,
unioned with whatever the script still hardcodes.

**So: a check's LOGIC materializes; a check's DATA must not.** Anything that
varies per repository — exempt commits, a repo's own branch names, paths,
people — is read at runtime from a file in the repo being checked, never
baked into the script that the sync will overwrite. A useful test while
writing one: *if a second repository installed this check tomorrow, is there
anything it would need to change inside the file itself?* If yes, that thing
is data, and it belongs in config.

The same audit carried a second lesson worth stating beside it. The
grandfather list was assembled from what an open item had recorded — two
commits. Auditing the branch's actual history found **eight**, none of them
overlapping the recorded two. A written record of which commits violate a
rule is a summary of a past reading, not the reading; the history itself is
the source of truth, and this is
[verify-decomposition](../practices/verify-decomposition.md) ("check the
parts, not the total") in the one form that costs real work to get right.

## What is still not enforced, and why not

Three practices in the remaining miss set carry no check, deliberately:

- **`mistakes-become-rules`** is the largest of them, and the phase-3 brief
  called this correctly: any check for it has to carry the **proportionality
  guard** that decides whether the practice fires at all, not just the
  encode-the-prevention half. A check that fires on every defect fix would mint
  a rule for every slip, which is the failure this plan opens by diagnosing.
  Detecting "this defect was worth a rule" from a diff is not something phase 4
  found an honest signature for, and a dishonest one would be worse than none.
- **`registry-source-of-truth`** and **`merge-runbook`** are properties of a
  repository's design, not of its files. Nothing phase 4 could write would
  distinguish "state lives in one registry" from "state happens to live in one
  place today".

Four other gaps are structural rather than judgment calls, and are worth
naming so nobody reads a skip as a decision: `computed-numbers-in-scripts`,
`docs-track-models`, `search-by-purpose` and `scripts-assert-properties` were
all skipping in this repository because nothing was registered for them to
check. [tools/catalogue_stats.py](../tools/catalogue_stats.py) closed all four
at once, and it exists because this repository was committing the exact failure
`docs-track-models` describes: [spec/LOADER.md](LOADER.md)'s status table said
the resident block was "~621 tokens" for the whole of phase 3, which had halved
it. Every gate was green, because no gate can see a number in a sentence.

## What phase 5 inherits

- **The registry is the place a new check goes.** Adding one means a case in
  `check_precedent_check_fires` in the same commit, or the harness fails: the
  registry and the case table check each other in both directions.
- **`--explain` is the contract.** A check whose `blind_to` line is empty or
  vague is a check nobody can calibrate against.
- **The creation pipeline should ask for a check, not a `checked_by`.** The
  thing phase 4 found is that the field is easy to fill in and the check is
  not; a promotion step that accepts a string has re-created the problem.
- **This channel existed only for the universal catalogue when phase 4
  closed**; it no longer does. Every practice set now runs
  `precedent_check.py --full-sweep` against its own tree, and a private
  set's check can run upstream too (the individual set's
  `check_commit_author` and `check_buenos_aires_dates` do) — see
  [spec/PRIVATE_ENFORCEMENT_BRIEF.md](PRIVATE_ENFORCEMENT_BRIEF.md) for how
  that gap was closed.
