summary:       "Every repo gets three branches with three levels of checking: pre-staging (seconds -- markdown lint and the leak gate), staging (every local check), main (every local check plus one GitHub test on the pull request into it, and in a public repo on every push to it as well). Many windows push to pre-staging and never wait; a Promote moves pre-staging to staging and pays the full check once for the whole batch. precedent-beta-v01 becomes staging."

# Three branch tiers -- pre-staging, staging, main

**The problem.** Morgan works in the cloud version of Claude Code, often
with eight or more windows open at once, each editing a different part of
the same document. Since the local push check came back on 2026-09-25
([precedent_push_check.py](../tools/precedent_push_check.py), wired by
[push-check-gate.sh](../templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/push-check-gate.sh)),
every push runs the full list, on every branch, including a session's own
working branch. Saving went from about a second to many minutes. He wants to
keep every check -- *"I love the long detail checks. Prevent so many
problems"* -- and stop waiting on them: *"even just 5 minutes still kills
flow."*

**The shape.** Checking depends on which branch is pushed to. Most pushes go
to a branch that checks in seconds; the full list runs once per batch, when
the batch is promoted.

**Status: accepted, being built.** As of 2026-09-25:

- **Steps 1 to 4 landed** (pull request #605): the branch-names module, the
  basic and full tiers, the push gate choosing by branch, and the merge gate.
- **Steps 5 to 7 landed** (pull request #606): pre-staging, `Promote`, the
  landing setting and the Boildown's Promote reminder. `landing_branch`
  defaults to staging until Alex has heard; Morgan's own `identity.json`
  sets `pre-staging`, so he has the lane now.
- **Step 8's rename landed**: every reader takes the `github_ci_` name first
  and the old `ci_` name where it is absent. Nobody's file was renamed yet --
  a person's `identity.json` is read by every repository's own vendored
  engine, and one still on an older engine would stop seeing a renamed key
  and fall back to the defaults, which run more CI, not less. Rename them
  once installs have taken this engine.
- **Step 8's workflow half and step 10 landed on pre-staging 2026-09-25,
  waiting on a Promote.** The workflow templates run GitHub only on a pull
  request into main (the light check) and, in a public repo, the leak check on
  every push; new installs get them by default. `[skip ci]` stays on as a
  backstop until every install carries the new files (Morgan: *"Backstops are
  good especially on this issue. We'll keep it until we're 100% sure all have
  been updated"*, strength: decided). `precedent-beta-v01` is renamed
  `staging`, with the old name kept and moved in step by every Promote; the
  default landing branch is pre-staging for everyone. Alex approved both,
  relayed by Morgan: *"Alex is on top of this and approves"*.
- **Promote covers both steps since 2026-09-26.** It picks pre-staging into
  staging or staging into main from the work just done, and prints which
  before it starts; into main it runs the full check and pushes a throwaway
  copy for the pull request (Morgan, strength: decided;
  [practices/promote.md](../practices/promote.md)).
- **Superseded, 2026-09-25 -- Step 8's behaviour was held for a decision**, because landing any part of
  it alone costs money: "never tag staging" would, today, start a runner on
  every push to staging in a private repo that has `leak-gate.yml`
  installed, since that workflow still triggers on every push. It has to land
  together with main-only triggers, and which workflow is a consuming
  repository's one GitHub test is not settled: a consumer install writes
  only `leak-gate.yml` today. Worked out in a brainstorm on 2026-09-25
and approved the same day. The decisions, with how firmly each was made
([decision-strength](../practices/decision-strength.md)):

| Decision | Morgan's words | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| Three tiers, checked by branch | *"to prestaging only the most minimal test; to staging/precedent-beta-v01 all local tests; and then to main, you get all those local tests AND the most important GitHub test"* | decided |
| No scheduled promotion | *"I think that it should not be on a cron"* | decided |
| The name | *"let's call it \"pre-staging\""* | decided |
| Every repo | *"I think all repos should use this."* | decided |
| Other branches get the basic check only, by default, for everyone | *"the default for everyone should be all branches other than the above never get tested beyond the basic markdown test when pushed to"* | decided |
| The staging branch is called `staging`, everywhere, and `precedent-beta-v01` is renamed | *"we should always call the staging one \"staging\" including renaming that branch to staging in precedent"* | decided |
| The leak gate joins the basic check | *"Good on nothing private going out."* | assented |
| The one GitHub test is the full check, on the pull request into main | *"Good on the one GitHub test."* | assented |
| The freshness guard syncs from pre-staging | *"the freshness guard at pre-staging is good"* | assented |
| Keep yesterday's CI settings as opt-ins rather than retiring them | raised as a question: *"would they still be useful in case someone turns in that they want CI on branches, or on prestaging"*, then the plan saying so approved | assented |
| Rename the GitHub settings to start with `github_ci_` | *"since those refer only to github's tests, maybe we rename them all to start with github_ci_ instead of ci_ to make that clear"* | decided |
| Build it | *"Otherwise, this looks great, let's do it, go ahead, go update"* | decided |
| The recommendations under "Settled at approval" below | approved with the plan as a whole, not one by one | assented |
| `Go update` lands on pre-staging by default | *"in go update" ruleset, the default place to push it to is "pre-staging"? Update the spec to reflect these"* | decided |
| Installs take their updates from main | *"Maybe vendored-in copies are now taken from \*main\*? [...] Update the spec to reflect these"* | decided -- with the 2026-09-24 reversal below in view |
| A high-risk change lands on pre-staging too, with a bolded Promote reminder in the reply and in The Boildown | *"the \"high risk\" ones should still go to pre-staging but have a strong, bolded message for me, in the main text as a paragraph and also in The Boildown, that now I need to push pre-staging to staging"* | decided |
| `landing_branch` may also say `main` | *"they have to be able to set it to \"main\" if they want, right?"* | decided |
| The primary branch is brought in line with the tiers | *"we now have a concept called \"primary branch\" - that should probably be updated in reference to this"* | decided |

## The rule

| Push to | Checks on our side | GitHub |
|---|---|---|
| any other branch (a session's own branch, a feature branch) | **basic** | none, unless the person opts in |
| **pre-staging** | **basic**, plus -- on the files the push changes, and nothing more -- the practice checks, a compile or parse of changed Python, shell and JSON files, a changed check's own test, and a changed practice's regenerated views (since 2026-09-27) | none, unless the person opts in |
| **staging** | **full** | none, unless the person opts in |
| **main** | **full** | **the full check, on the pull request into main** -- and, in a public repository, on every push to main too |

**Basic** is the markdown lint on the files the push touches and the leak
gate over the tree. Measured here on 2026-09-25: the lint under a second, the
leak gate about five. The commit-author check
([commit-identity-push-gate.sh](../templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/commit-identity-push-gate.sh))
is separate, instant, and unchanged. **The leak gate is in the basic check
because pushing any branch to a public repository publishes it**; it cannot
wait for promotion.

**Full** is everything [precedent_push_check.py](../tools/precedent_push_check.py)
runs today for the repo's kind. In this repo that includes the verification
harness, about four minutes by [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)'s own measurement,
and it is most of the wait.

**The GitHub test on main** is the full check run in GitHub's clean
environment, on the pull request into main, so it blocks a bad merge rather
than reporting one afterwards. It is the one thing a local run cannot prove:
AGENTS.md already says local green is not CI green, because a session's
container resolves private sources that GitHub's does not. Main is merged
into rarely, so the cost stays small even in a private repository.

**One exception to "GitHub only on main":** a public repository keeps
[leak-gate.yml](../.github/workflows/leak-gate.yml) on every push. It is
free there, and it is the only thing that catches an edit made on github.com
without going through a session.

### Public repositories test every push to main

**Since 2026-09-27, a public repository also runs main's GitHub test on
every push to main**, not only on the pull request into it. Morgan: *"all
pushes to main, on repos that are public, should get the GitHub ci/cd. It
doesn't matter that the same check happened (on our server) on local before
that, it's a good double check"*, then *"let's do this change, go update"*
(strength: decided).

The pull request's run tests a change before it lands; the push run tests
what actually landed. It is the only GitHub test a commit gets when it
reaches main **without** that pull request: a direct push, an edit on
github.com, a bot commit, or a pull request merged after main moved on
under it. Until this, those waited for the next Promote to be tested.

**A push whose files already passed is not tested again.** Morgan, the same
day, on learning that the two runs of a Promote are both GitHub's: *"we're
very cautious about the minutes. So ... it should not run the second time
... if it had just run before, and nothing had changed"* (strength:
decided). The push run's first step asks git whether the pushed commit's
files are exactly those of a commit this same workflow already passed on,
with anything else the push brought in already inside that commit, and
stops there if so. That is the ordinary Promote merge: the pull request's
head already contains main, so the merge lands the very files its run
tested. Anything short of certain runs the check -- main moved in between,
no passing run found, GitHub's API unreachable, a shallow checkout. A
skipped push still starts a runner for those few seconds; it saves the
test itself, not the runner. [verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py)'s
`check_push_to_main_skips_what_already_passed` runs the step against a real
git history, with the cases where it must not skip beside the ones where it
must.

**Private repositories are unchanged.** The consumer template
([light-check.yml.template](../templates/github-actions/light-check.yml.template))
carries the push trigger everywhere and a job-level condition that skips it
unless GitHub reports the repository as public. A skipped job gets no
runner and bills nothing, and a repository that changes visibility follows
without an edit. This repo's own
[deep-check.yml](../.github/workflows/deep-check.yml) is public and carries
the trigger plainly.

**Only new installs get it on their own.** The light check is written at
install and never refreshed (`CI_INSTALL_ONLY_TEMPLATES` in
[precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)), since
many repos run a light check of their own. A public repository installed
before this date gets it only by an edit to its own `light-check.yml`,
approved by the person there
([ci-workflow-approved](../practices/ci-workflow-approved.md)).

## What each tier checks

**Into `pre-staging`: fast, and only about the change** -- the lint, the
leak gate, the author checks, and since 2026-09-27 the practice checks, a
compile or parse of each changed Python, shell or JSON file, a changed
check's own test, and a changed practice's regenerated views: only the files the push creates or
changes, and the generated files a changed practice feeds. **Into `staging`:
the full suite, on every file. Into `main`: the full suite, plus the
repository's GitHub test.** A new check states its tier when it is added.
The rule, and why the split is this one:
[checks-follow-the-tier](../practices/checks-follow-the-tier.md) (Morgan,
2026-09-27, strength: decided).

## What a working day looks like

1. Eight windows open. Each edits, commits, and pushes to **pre-staging** --
   basic check, seconds -- and is free again.
2. Before each push, a window pulls in what the others already pushed, so
   the windows see each other's edits almost live and conflicts stay small.
3. When Morgan wants the batch checked, he says **Promote** in any window and
   leaves it in the background. It merges pre-staging into staging, the push
   to staging runs the full check, and it reports what landed -- or what
   failed.
4. If the full check fails, staging does not move. The same window fixes it
   on pre-staging and promotes again. The other windows keep pushing to
   pre-staging the whole time.
5. Staging reaches main the way beta reaches main today: a pull request, the
   GitHub test, and the repo's own approval rule -- in this repository, Alex's
   named go-ahead for a major change
   ([merge-target-is-beta-branch](../local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md)).

## The branch names are the same everywhere

**`pre-staging`, `staging`, `main`, in every repository** -- this one, the
practice sources, and every repository that installs Precedent. A repo that
today has only `main` gains the other two; routine work that used to land on
its `main` lands on pre-staging, and main takes it by promotion.

**Names live in one place.** Today the literal `precedent-beta-v01` appears
in 249 files in this repository alone, 37 of them under `tools/` (measured
2026-09-25 at 1c37df3f), and in 30 to 64 files in each of the four practice
sources. Before anything is renamed, every tool reads the three names from
one module ([registry-source-of-truth](../practices/registry-source-of-truth.md)),
so the rename is a one-line change for code. Prose is different: a current
rule is rewritten to say `staging`; a `## Story` section or a closed item
keeps the name it had at the time, because it is history.

## Settings

**Our own checks** get one new setting:

- **`branch_push_checks`** -- `"basic"` (the default, for everyone) or
  `"full"`. It governs pushes to every branch other than staging and main,
  pre-staging included. Read from the person's `identity.json`; a repo's
  `precedent.json` may override it, the same pattern
  [CI_CADENCE_PLAN.md](CI_CADENCE_PLAN.md) uses. Nothing can lower the check
  on staging or main.
- **`promote_only`** (added 2026-09-25, off unless set) -- `true` in a
  person's `identity.json` makes staging and main take work only by
  promotion, for that person: the push gate refuses a `git push` to either,
  and the merge gate refuses a pull request into either unless its head is
  the tier directly below (pre-staging into staging, staging into main).
  Promote pushes from inside [`precedent_branches.py`](../tools/precedent_branches.py), where no gate sees
  it, so the sanctioned route stays open. A per-person opt-in on purpose:
  Morgan, *"please make this an INDIVIDUAL rule for me, because I believe
  that Alex and others won't necessarily use this system"*.

**A repository gets a real staging branch** with `--ensure-tiers --apply`
(added 2026-09-25, part of every migration and every Update Vendors). Where
the staging tier had been `main`, it creates `staging` and writes
`"staging_branch": "staging"` into `precedent.json`; `base_branch` is left
alone, since it also pins where a practice source's session clone sits, and
that stays `main` (below).

**GitHub's checks** keep the three existing settings, with the default
narrowed to main and each one becoming the way to widen it. **Each is
renamed to start with `github_ci_`**, because each governs GitHub's runs
only and never our own checks -- the bare `ci_` prefix let a reader think
`ci_on_branches: false` meant "no checks on branches". A reader accepts the
old name for as long as any file still carries it, and the new name wins
where both appear:

- **`github_ci_workflows`** (was `ci_workflows`) -- whether the installer writes a GitHub workflow into
  a repo at all. **The default becomes `"enabled"`**, installing a workflow
  that triggers only on pull requests into main, so every repository gets
  its main test. `"disabled"` still means no workflow, and then main has no
  GitHub test -- a choice, said out loud at install time. Morgan's own
  `identity.json` says `"disabled"` today and would change to `"enabled"`
  for his main test to exist.
- **`github_ci_on_branches`** (was `ci_on_branches`) -- `false` by default now. `true` adds GitHub runs
  on pushes to pre-staging, staging and other branches, for someone who wants
  them.
- **`github_ci_every_hours`** (was `ci_every_hours`) -- still caps how often those opted-in runs happen
  in a private repo. **It never skips the main test.**

## Five holes this has to close

**1. A merge through GitHub skips the local gate.** A session that merges a
pull request with GitHub's merge tool makes no local push, so the push gate
never runs. Today that is safe only because the branch was fully checked when
it was pushed; under this plan it got the basic check. **A second gate runs
before the merge tool** (`mcp__github__merge_pull_request`, and `gh pr merge`
where a harness has it): when the pull request targets staging or main, it
runs the full check on the pull request's head first and refuses the merge
on a failure.

**2. Pre-staging falls behind when someone pushes to staging directly.**
Alex, or anyone who does not use pre-staging, may push straight to staging
(fully checked). Windows syncing from pre-staging would not see that work.
**The freshness guard reports it at session start and names the command**,
`python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --sync-pre-staging`, which merges
staging into pre-staging -- a basic-tier push, seconds. The guard itself
never merges a base, the rule it has always kept, since a merge from a
hook is a merge nobody chose to make. `Go update` landing on pre-staging
and Promote both run the same sync first, and it stops and reports on a
conflict rather than guessing.

**3. A `[skip ci]` line could silence the main test.** GitHub skips
pull-request workflows when the head commit says `[skip ci]`
([CI_CADENCE_PLAN.md](CI_CADENCE_PLAN.md), "The branch switch"), and with
`github_ci_on_branches` off, commits on pre-staging carry that line. If staging were
fast-forwarded onto one of them, the pull request from staging into main
would get no run. So **Promote always makes a merge commit** (`--no-ff`),
which the cadence hook never tags, and **the hook never tags a commit on
staging**. The move from staging to main is a merge, never a squash -- a
squash message would carry the branch's `[skip ci]` lines with it.

**4. Main moves on its own** (added 2026-09-26). The tiers assumed main
moves only by the pull request from staging. It does not: a workflow can
commit straight to main -- one consuming repository has two that do, one
weekly -- and so can an edit on GitHub's website or a direct push. None of
that climbs through pre-staging, so the next pull request into main meets
it as a conflict. **The sync that `Go update` and Promote run first now
copies main down into pre-staging too**, a basic-tier push like the staging
sync; the next Promote carries it up to staging. It never pushes to staging
or main. A repository whose staging tier IS main has nothing to copy.

**5. Work that went round the checks spreads unchecked** (added
2026-09-26). A bot commit, a web edit or a direct push reaches staging or
main without the checks that tier requires. **Nothing is copied down until
it has them**: for staging, the full local check; for main, that plus the
GitHub test where one is installed. A published full-check receipt for the
tip's exact tree counts (none means it went round the system, or the
receipt aged out -- both are unchecked); for main's GitHub test, a run on
the commit itself or on the pull request that brought it in. Promote runs
whatever is missing -- the full check in a throwaway worktree, the GitHub
test by the workflow's `workflow_dispatch` button, which every shipped
test workflow already carries, so no workflow file changes -- and waits up
to 30 minutes for the answer. **`Go update` only looks**: it copies what is
already checked and names `--sync-pre-staging --check` for the rest, since
a GitHub test can take many minutes and landing on pre-staging is meant to
be instant. A failure is not copied and is reported with the commit and
the check: the work is live on that tier already, so skipping the copy
hides nothing, and the fix goes the normal way -- pre-staging, Promote, the
pull request into main. Morgan, 2026-09-26: *"a good point to check to make
sure anything that got onto main not through our system [...] had those
checks and if not we should do it, including the GitHub CI/CD for main, and
also for staging, if it got there through a different route"* (strength:
decided).

**Only a file change is drift.** Right after an ordinary pull request from
staging into main, main is ahead of pre-staging by two merge commits (the
Promote merge and the pull request's) whose files pre-staging already has
-- measured 2026-09-26 in two repositories. The test is whether merging the
upper branch in would change a file (`git merge-tree`), not whether the
two tips are equal: a plain diff of the tips calls main different whenever
pre-staging has moved on past it, which is most of the time. Such merges
get no check, no copy and no note at session start (Morgan: *"yes add
that"*). The freshness guard names the rest, per tier, with a count and
*checked* or *unchecked*: `python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --drift`.

**What 4 and 5 cost.** The local checks bill nothing. Each GitHub test the
sync starts bills at least one Actions minute in a private repository; a
public one, like this, bills none. Most private repositories get no GitHub
test once they have taken the update (`github_ci_workflows` disabled, and
[ci-workflow-approved](../practices/ci-workflow-approved.md) asks about each
workflow at every update), and there the expected cost is zero. The API
calls are counted by [`tools/github_budget.py`](../tools/github_budget.py) against a declared budget of
60 per run in [`tools/github_api_budgets.json`](../tools/github_api_budgets.json): up to three to read a
commit's state, and one per poll while a started test runs.

## Who it binds

**Changed 2026-09-27** (Morgan, strength: decided): the built-in default
landing branch is `staging`; a person's `landing_branch` wins, then the
repository's; new repositories are written with `pre-staging`. The
paragraph below is the plan as first written.

**Every repository has the three branches, and `Go update` lands on
pre-staging by default, for everyone.** Pushing straight to staging stays
allowed, and is fully checked, so someone who prefers to work that way --
Alex, perhaps -- loses nothing: a per-person setting, `landing_branch`,
set to `"staging"` in that person's own `identity.json`, sends their
`Go update` there instead. Alex hears about this before it ships (step 6),
since it changes where his sessions land their work.

## The primary branch is pre-staging

[primary-branch](../practices/primary-branch.md) defines the primary branch
as *"the one shared branch regular work pushes to and pull requests
target"*. Under this plan that is **pre-staging**, in every repository:
`Go update`, `Push directly` with no branch named, and a session's pull
request all land there. Staging and main are not the primary branch; they
are what the primary branch is promoted into.

Two things in that practice change with it:

- **The repository no longer chooses the name.** Today each repository
  declares its own primary branch (`base_branch` in `precedent.json`), and
  the practice says that choice never travels to the repositories that
  take updates from it. With the same three names everywhere, the tiers are
  one universal rule rather than one repository's rule, and they travel
  like any other practice.
- **`base_branch` means staging until the rename is done.** Every tool that
  reads it today reads it as "where finished work lands", which is what
  staging now is. It is read through the one branch-names module (step 1),
  never directly, so the rename changes one place.

## Installs take their updates from main

**Done, 2026-09-25**, right after the first merge of staging into main
(#629): `SOURCE_BRANCH` in `tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py` and
`tools/precedent_refresh_sources.py` reads `main`, and runbook step 1
repoints an install pinned to staging. Morgan: *"Yes, switch all installs
to main. ... Let's do it, go ahead, go update"* (strength: decided). Each
install moves at its own next Update Vendors.

**Every install -- every repository that vendors Precedent, and every
practice source a session clones -- takes its updates from `main`**, all
of them at once, not some now and some later. That is the one branch whose
content has passed every local check *and* the GitHub test.

This has been tried once already: on 2026-09-24 installs were pointed at
main and moved back to `precedent-beta-v01` the same day, because that
approval had been *"more an assent, than a decision"*, and because the
move had left installs split across two branches. Morgan then: *"they
should all be consistent and following the same one. Maybe later we'll
move them all to follow main"*. This is that later move, and it keeps
both conditions: decided, and every install at once.

**What it costs:** a change reaches Morgan's other repositories only after
it reaches main -- in this repository, a merge that needs Alex's named
go-ahead when the change is major. Work that sits on staging waiting for
that merge is invisible to every install.

**What it simplifies:** the rename (step 9) no longer touches any install,
because no install follows staging. Only sessions working inside the
Precedent repositories themselves see the old and new names.

## Build steps

In order. Each step leaves every repository working.

1. **One module for the branch names**, and every tool reads from it.
   Nothing is renamed yet; the staging name still resolves to
   `precedent-beta-v01` wherever that is still the branch.
2. **Tier the push check.** Each entry in `PUSH_CHECKS` is tagged basic or
   full; `--tier basic|full` selects. The record of a passing tree names the
   tier, so a basic pass never satisfies a full gate.
3. **The push gate picks the tier by target branch**, per the table and
   `branch_push_checks`. Same change in the template copy under
   `templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/`.
4. **The merge gate** (hole 1), in the harness adapter, with a
   harness-neutral script behind it
   ([vendor-neutral-by-default](../local/practices/vendor-neutral-by-default.md)).
5. **Pre-staging exists.** Created from staging (today, `base_branch`) on first use in
   any repository; the freshness guard syncs from it and merges staging in
   (hole 2).
6. **`Go update` and `Push directly` land on pre-staging**, unless the
   person's `landing_branch` says staging; **a new `Promote` command** does
   the merge and push to staging, as a new practice file; and
   [primary-branch](../practices/primary-branch.md),
   [go-update](../practices/go-update.md) and
   [push-directly](../practices/push-directly.md) are rewritten to say so.
   Alex hears about it first.
7. **The Boildown's "not yet landed" line becomes a Promote reminder**:
   commits on pre-staging and not on staging are named, with the
   recommendation to Promote.
8. **GitHub workflow templates trigger on pull requests into main only**,
   plus the opt-ins; the three settings take their `github_ci_` names; the
   `github_ci_workflows` default flips; the cadence hook
   stops tagging staging (hole 3). This repo's own
   [deep-check.yml](../.github/workflows/deep-check.yml), paused on
   2026-09-25, comes back scoped to pull requests into main.
9. **Installs follow main.** `SOURCE_BRANCH` in
   [precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py) and
   [precedent_refresh_sources.py](../tools/precedent_refresh_sources.py)
   becomes `main`, with every other pin that names a branch, in one change,
   and reaches each install through its next
   [Update Vendors](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md). Nothing here
   waits on the rename, and the rename then waits on nothing here.
10. **The rename.** Create `staging` at `precedent-beta-v01`'s tip in each
   Precedent repository, and move every `base_branch` to it. **Keep
   `precedent-beta-v01` updated alongside `staging`** until no session
   still pushes to the old name. Then stop updating it and hand
   over the one-click delete link
   ([never-delete-a-remote-branch](../practices/never-delete-a-remote-branch.md)).
   Rewrite the current rules -- AGENTS.md's merge-target paragraph first --
   to say `staging`. **Waits on Alex hearing about it first** (below).

   **Other sessions keep working through the rename.** Nothing is deleted
   or renamed in place; `staging` is added beside the old branch. During
   the transition, a sync -- run by Promote, by the freshness guard, and by
   any push to either branch -- merges each branch into the other and pushes
   both, so a session in another repository that still pushes to
   `precedent-beta-v01`, or an install not yet moved to main (step 9), sees the
   same content it would have seen anyway. The one conflict it cannot settle
   by itself is two sessions changing the same lines on the two branches at
   once; it stops and reports that, exactly as a merge would today. A
   one-click GitHub rename is ruled out for this reason: it would leave every
   session that is mid-work pushing to a name that no longer means what it
   did.
11. **Tests** in [verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py): each tier
    by branch, the setting and its override, the merge gate, the
    staging-into-pre-staging merge, Promote's `--no-ff`, and the rename
    transition.

**This is high-risk work** under [go-update](../practices/go-update.md): it
changes gating code and a governance rule. Each step goes through a pull
request. It also changes content other repositories vendor, so it reaches
them only through Update Vendors
([vendor-rollout-disclosed](../practices/vendor-rollout-disclosed.md)).

## Settled at approval

1. **Where `Go update` lands** is pre-staging by default; the per-person
   `landing_branch` can send one person's to staging instead.
2. **The command word is `Promote`.**
3. **Alex hears about the rename before step 10 runs.** It renames the branch
   his own merge-target rule is named after and changes where he pushes. It
   is not a main merge, so the rule does not require his go-ahead; he should
   still hear about it before it happens rather than after. He also hears
   before step 6, which changes where his sessions land their work.

## What this gives up

- **A failed promotion does not say which window broke it.** The batch is
  checked together. Promoting often keeps batches small; the failure names
  the commits since the last green promotion.
- **A break on pre-staging spreads** until someone promotes and sees it --
  the other windows build on it in the meantime. Cheap for content; worse for
  code. A person working on tools or hooks can set `branch_push_checks` to
  `"full"`.
- **"Is my edit live?" gets a second answer**: on pre-staging, waiting for
  Promote.
- **Every window trusts a pass any window recorded.** Promote never re-runs
  the suite on files that already passed it (Morgan, 2026-09-25, decided).
  The record of a pass first lived in one checkout's `.git`, so a Promote
  said in another window ran the suite again; since 2026-09-25 it is also
  published to origin as a small receipt on the branch
  `precedent-check-receipts` -- one file per pass, naming the files by hash
  and carrying none of them, each commit marked `[skip ci]` (Morgan: "#2
  okay. Go update", decided). A branch, not a hidden ref: a cloud session's
  git proxy refused the hidden ref with a 403. The cost is trust: anyone who can push to origin
  can write one, and every checkout believes it. Only the push check writes
  them, and only after every check passed.
