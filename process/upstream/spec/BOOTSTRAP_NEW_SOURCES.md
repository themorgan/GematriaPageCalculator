# Bootstrapping a Brand-New Individual or Shared Set

This is the generalized, repeatable procedure for the case
[the guided-install conversation](../SETUP.md) step 2 and
[INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) step 9 both used to leave as a dead end: an
adopter with **no** individual practice repo and **no** shared-set practice repo
yet, who wants one. It exists because every other piece of documentation
about individual/shared sources — this document included until now —
assumed the repo already existed.

**This is a different document from
[PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md](PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md), on purpose.** That brief
records how `themorgan/precedent-individual` and
`themorgan/precedent-shared-repo-maintenance` were actually populated: bespoke,
one-off work, done from a session opened directly against those two
already-*existing* private repos, carrying RepoPersonalPreferences' (RPP)
real 46 rules across.
It is a historical record of this project's own phase-3 work, not a
procedure anyone else should follow. This document is the opposite: no
private content, no existing repo assumed, meant to be followed by any
adopter, any number of times.

## What the tool does, and does not do

[`tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py`](../tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py)
mechanizes everything that does not require credentials this tool can't
assume a session has:

- Copies [`templates/practice-set-individual/`](../templates/practice-set-individual/)
  or [`templates/practice-set-shared/`](../templates/practice-set-shared/) into
  a target directory, filling in the owner's name (and, for a team, its
  first approver's name and GitHub handle) wherever the skeleton names a
  placeholder.
- **Reports an EXISTING set's shape** — `python3
  tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py --verify PATH`, new 2026-09-11. It
  writes nothing, reads the level off the set (`--level` overrides), lists
  everything a complete set of that level has and this one does not, and
  exits 1 if the list is non-empty. The underlying check had existed since
  2026-09-06 and was reachable only from
  [`tools/verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py), while three
  documents already told operators to run a flag that did not exist.
  **This is also the route by which an EXISTING set gets a field the
  skeleton gained after that set was built**, and `pronouns` (2026-09-12) is
  the first: a migrated set holds no `pronouns` key at all rather than an
  unfilled `{{PERSON_PRONOUNS}}`, so the placeholder sweep cannot see it and
  `--verify` names the absent key directly. `register` (2026-09-14) is the
  second, found the same way. Its remedy is not a file edit
  you can make alone — **ask the person whose set it is and write their
  answer in** ([practices/declared-pronouns.md](../practices/declared-pronouns.md)).
- **Installs the session hooks, including the one that makes the person's
  own practices resolve here** — `freshness-guard.sh` and
  `commit-identity.sh` from
  [`templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/`](../templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/),
  and since 2026-09-13
  [`individual-source-bootstrap.sh.template`](../templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/individual-source-bootstrap.sh.template)
  as the set's own `.claude/hooks/precedent-individual-bootstrap.sh`, wired
  **first** in `SessionStart` because `commit-identity.sh` reads the
  individual set for the author and the timezone. **A practice set is a
  repository somebody works in**, and until that date a session rooted in
  one resolved no individual practice source at all — nothing there ever
  wrote `~/.config/precedent/config.json`, so every personal rule was
  silently absent while the session applied the ones it could see. The hook
  that writes it existed and could not be installed:
  [`tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py`](../tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py),
  which it execs, was in `CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES` only, and hand-copying an
  engine file in is correctly refused (`UNTRACKED ENGINE FILE`). It bakes in
  no account — the set is derived from `$PRECEDENT_SOURCE_BASE_URL`, with
  `~/.config/precedent/config.json` read ahead of that — and it clones to
  `$HOME/precedent-individual` **even in `precedent-individual` itself**,
  deliberately: pointing the config at the checkout in place would hand
  `precedent_source_bootstrap.py` the session's own working tree, whose
  branch pin puts a clean clone back on `main` before pulling. A second
  checkout keeps the resolved source and the tree being edited apart, and it
  is the path `PRECEDENT_FRESHNESS_ALSO` already names.
  **Neither half reaches a set that already exists**: an existing
  `.claude/settings.json` is never rewritten, and `--apply` writes no hook
  file there either — a hook nothing declares is reported rather than
  repaired, since writing one that still never runs is a diff nobody asked
  for. So [`tools/precedent_refresh_sources.py`](../tools/precedent_refresh_sources.py)
  reports the hook as unwired at every session start and a person adds both
  the file and the one command.
- **Points the set at the universal catalogue, since 2026-09-13** — a
  `{"level": "universal", "name": "precedent", "path": "../BestPractice"}`
  entry in the set's own `precedent.json`, ONE `SessionStart` step —
  `.claude/hooks/precedent-universal-catalogue.sh`, which clones the declared
  sources and then renders — and `.precedent/` in its `.gitignore`.
  **It shipped as two inline commands in `settings.json` and was changed to a
  script the same day**, because the harness refuses a session editing
  `.claude/settings.json` (*"Reason: [Self-Modification]"*) — inconsistently:
  of the four sets rolled out that day three sessions edited it unchallenged
  and the fourth was refused, so a person had to make that edit by hand.
  Anything named in `settings.json` is a thing only a person can change;
  a script it points at is an ordinary tracked file. Every other entry in a
  set's `settings.json` already used the script form.
  Until that date **a set resolved nothing**: its generated occasion index
  carried its own entries and not one of universal's 94, so a session rooted
  in a set worked with every universal rule silently absent — measured, with
  a real failure attached in
  [`practices/seeded-prompt-names-its-origin.md`](../practices/seeded-prompt-names-its-origin.md)'s
  `## Story`. The rules arrive in an **untracked**
  `.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md`, rebuilt each session, so no copy of
  universal's text is ever committed into a set
  ([spec/SOURCE_SET_PROSE_GAP.md](SOURCE_SET_PROSE_GAP.md) costs the
  committed alternatives and rejects them).
  **The path is a relative sibling and not `~/BestPractice`**, which is the
  measured answer rather than the tidy one: `$HOME` is `/root` on some
  containers and `/home/user` on others, and an individual set is cloned
  under `$HOME` while the shared sets sit beside the consuming repo — so a `~`
  path names nothing on the container where the sets actually live. The
  sibling is correct everywhere because the clone step creates it there,
  from the URL and branch the set's own `tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json` already
  records. No credential: this repository is public.
  **Neither half reaches a set that already exists**, for the same reason as
  the hooks above — `bootstrap()` runs only when a set is created. What
  covers those is `--verify`, which names both the missing declaration and
  the missing wiring as separate findings, because they fail separately: a
  set with the declaration and no wiring resolves universal and shows a
  session nothing, and a set with the wiring and no declaration runs a step
  that finds nothing to do. All four sets that existed on 2026-09-13 have
  neither.
- **Installs no workflow.** A practice set runs no CI since 2026-09-21
  (practice `source-sets-run-no-ci`). Its generated views (`AGENTS.md`'s
  loader block, `MAP.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`) are checked by the set's own full
  sweep before every push:
  [`tools/precedent_check.py`](../tools/precedent_check.py)'s
  `generated-artifact-provenance` runs `build_views.py --check`, and has run
  in a set since `binds_publishers` (2026-09-12). From 2026-09-11 this step
  installed a views-drift workflow for that; its template was retired on
  2026-10-01, and `--verify` does not ask for one.
- **Vendors a real engine into the new set's own `tools/`** —
  [`tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py`](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)'s
  `seed()`, called from `bootstrap()` itself, with no separate step to
  remember. This is no longer optional or manual: every set this tool
  produces gets `build_views.py`, `precedent_gate.py`, `precedent_paths.py`,
  `precedent_show.py`, `split_practices.py`, a trimmed `routing_scope.json`,
  and `precedent_vendor_engine.py` itself (so the vendoring mechanism can
  update its own already-bootstrapped copies too), plus a
  `tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json` recording which BestPractice commit it came
  from and a sha256 per file. See "The vendored engine" below — this is new
  as of this document's 2026-09-05 update; before it, the tool wrote only
  practice content, config, approvers and the leak-blocklist, and every
  engine copy that existed (`precedent-individual`,
  `precedent-shared-repo-maintenance`) came from an undocumented, one-off
  hand-copy that nothing could tell was stale (`precedent-team-tms`'s, as that set was named at the time, was
  simply missing).
- Refuses to write into a non-empty destination without `--force true`.
- Prints — or, opted in with `--write-user-config true` /
  `--write-repo-config PATH`, writes — the exact wiring the next step
  needs: the `~/.config/precedent/config.json` `individual` block, or the
  consuming project's `precedent.json` `"sources"` entry.

**It never touches a git remote or any hosting API.** Creating the actual
repository — `gh repo create`, or a few clicks on GitHub — needs
credentials or a platform capability this tool can't assume any given
session has, and guessing wrong there is worse than asking. That step
stays explicit, below.

## The vendored engine

A brand-new individual or shared set is a source repo, not a four-source
consumer — it has no `process/upstream/` tree and no use for
[`precedent_materialize.py`](../tools/precedent_materialize.py)/
[`precedent_resolve.py`](../tools/precedent_resolve.py)/
[`precedent_sync_views.py`](../tools/precedent_sync_views.py), which only
a consumer resolving universal+team+individual+repo-local sources together
needs. What it needs is enough to run its own
`AGENTS.md` loader block — **and, since 2026-09-13, enough to resolve the
person's own individual source, because a practice set is a repository
somebody works in like any other**: the files
[`tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py`](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)'s
own docstring names as `ENGINE_FILES`, plus a routing-vocabulary fixture
(`routing_scope.json`, trimmed to the closed gate vocabulary
[`precedent_gate.py`](../tools/precedent_gate.py) needs — BestPractice's
own copy also documents the routing reason for every one of *its* 60-odd
practices, which has no meaning in a different catalogue).

`precedent_vendor_engine.py` is itself one of the vendored files, on
purpose: it travels with the engine it defines, so an improvement to the
vendoring mechanism reaches an already-bootstrapped set the same way an
improvement to [`build_views.py`](../tools/build_views.py) does. Once a
set exists, refreshing it later needs a sibling clone of BestPractice (the
same shape [`tools/checkin.py`](../tools/checkin.py) already uses for a
consumer's check-in cycle) and one command:

```
python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py status  ../BestPractice   # drift? behind?
python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh ../BestPractice   # pull, re-vendor, re-stamp
```

### How a set finds out it is behind

Until 2026-09-06 there were none, and the cost was real: two live sets sat
more than two hundred commits behind this repo, both generating a loader
block with a defect fixed upstream days earlier. Nothing was broken — there
was simply no channel through which *"your copy is behind"* could reach
anyone. It surfaced only because a session happened to have a clone of this
repo attached and happened to run `status` by hand.

The reason a source set was harder than a consumer repo is worth stating,
because it explains the shape of all three answers. A consumer vendors
`process/upstream/` and its bootstrap runs a freshness check at session
start. A source set could not do the same: `refresh` needs a clone of *this*
repo to compare against, and a person's ordinary session has no reason to
have one.

| Channel | Runs | Needs a clone? |
|---|---|---|
| The warning [tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py](../tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py) prints when the checkout it is seeding *from* is itself behind | At bootstrap | No — it is running inside one |
| [tools/precedent_refresh_sources.py](../tools/precedent_refresh_sources.py), from a session working in this repo | Every session start here | No — this checkout *is* the clone |

Both are incidental: they fire when someone happens to be bootstrapping, or
happens to be working in this repo. Neither runs on a schedule, so a set
nobody touches for a month is told nothing for a month.

### The scheduled channel, and why there is not one

**There is no scheduled refresh anywhere, at any level, as of
2026-09-14.** Not in the templates, not in the shared sets, not in anyone's
individual set. The third channel a reader expects to find here does not
exist, and its absence is a decision rather than a gap.

Morgan, 2026-09-14, in his own words: *"I think that engine-refresh.yml is
now doing an automatic update weekly. Let's stop that. No weekly updates. I
had that weeks ago, but we're not doing that anymore; this is now really
complex and deserves hand attention and issues come up every time and I'm
on it every day anyway."* **Strength:** decided
([decision-strength](../practices/decision-strength.md)) — he asked for it
outright rather than accepting a proposal.

The measurement behind it: two scheduled runs produced two abandoned
branches — **a 100% report rate against a 0% landing rate.** The clock was
never the bottleneck; the landing step was, and a faster clock only
produces more pull requests nobody merges. It is the same reasoning that
retired `bestpractice-sync` on 2026-09-11 (*"now that it's getting more
complex, I'm more hesitant about syncing it automatically"*), so this
finished a direction rather than opening one.

**The replacement channel is a person saying "Update Vendors" in a
session** — the fixed sequence in
[`vendor-update-runbook`](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md). So a set
nobody touches for a month really is told nothing for a month, and that is
now the accepted cost rather than a problem awaiting a cron.

#### Superseded: why it was kept out of the templates (2026-09-06)

**This paragraph is history.** It was the reasoning that removed the job
from the templates while leaving it alive for individuals, and the
2026-09-14 decision above supersedes its conclusion — the answer turned out
to be no clock at all, not "a clock, but only for those who opt in". Its
premise still holds and is worth keeping, which is why it is here rather
than deleted.

It was added to both source templates on 2026-09-06 and removed the same
day. Not because it broke — because a template is the wrong place to make
that choice. A scheduled workflow inherited by every adopter is a cron job
phoning a remote every week, consuming their Actions minutes, opening pull
requests in their repository, on a schedule they did not pick. That is a
real imposition, and "it is good for you" is not a reason to install it in
someone's repo without asking. The clause that followed — *"it now lives at
the individual level, in the practice set of whoever wants it"* — is the
half that is no longer true: **superseded 2026-09-14, it lives nowhere**,
and the individual set's copy is being removed too.

#### Superseded: the shape, if anyone ever rebuilds it

**Also history, and deliberately kept.** Nobody is expected to build this —
the decision above is that no repository runs it. It is recorded so that a
future attempt does not have to re-derive the two GitHub behaviours that
cost a day to find (the pull-request permission that is off by default, and
the issue fallback):

- Clone this repo's `precedent-beta-v01`, run `precedent_vendor_engine.py
  refresh`, then `build_views.py`. **Both**, in one commit: a refreshed
  generator whose views have not been re-run leaves the set failing its own
  `build_views --check`.
- Use the resulting **diff** as the signal — `git status --porcelain` empty
  means the engine was already current. Do not parse a notice string.
- Push a branch, then try to open a pull request. This needs a GitHub
  setting that is **off by default** and that an organization or enterprise
  can withhold entirely: *Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
  requests*, under Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions.
- **Do not let the notification depend on that setting.** Fall back to
  opening an issue, which needs only `issues: write` and which nothing
  gates; put a `compare/<base>...<branch>?expand=1` link in it so the person
  opens the pull request themselves in one click. Fall back *only* on that
  specific permission error, so an unrelated failure still fails loudly.
- Keep one issue, reused, and close it when a later run finds the engine
  current — so an open issue means *stale now*, not *was stale once*.

```
```

`refresh` pulls BestPractice's `precedent-beta-v01` branch specifically —
not whatever branch is configured as the clone's default — because that is
where routine engine work lands until Alex's own, deliberate phase-7
fold-in into `main` (see
[`local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md`](../local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md)).
It refuses to overwrite a vendored file that was hand-edited locally
(detected by comparing the file's sha256 against what `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`
recorded) unless `--force` is passed — this engine is meant to carry zero
local variance, so a hand-edit is a signal something needs to move
upstream into BestPractice instead, not to be silently discarded.

**If the set ships harness adapters, declare them.** A source whose practices
tell a consuming repo to install a `bootstrap/*.sh` into its `.claude/hooks/`
adds an `adapters` list to the set's own `precedent.json`, and every consuming
repo then receives the script on its next sync instead of by hand-copy:

```json
"adapters": [
  {"from": "bootstrap/freshness-guard.sh",
   "to":   ".claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh"}
]
```

The settings snippet beside it stays a hand-merge, deliberately — it carries a
base branch each repo replaces with its own, and a declared destination named
`settings.json` is refused for exactly that reason. Full reasoning, and what
happens to a consumer that edited its copy, in
[`spec/SOURCES.md`](SOURCES.md)'s "Harness adapters travel with the source".

**Why this isn't `tools/checkin.py` extended, rather than a new tool**:
`checkin.py` mirrors a consumer's entire `process/upstream/` tree,
deleting anything the tree no longer has, in both directions. A source
repo's `tools/` directory holds vendored engine files *alongside*
non-vendored, repo-owned ones (`tools/checks/`, most obviously) that a
whole-directory mirror-and-delete would destroy, and the flow here is
one-directional (a source has nothing of its own to check in upstream) —
different enough on both axes that overloading `checkin.py` with a second
manifest shape and a "named file set" mode would have cost more clarity
than a small, purpose-built tool.

**The four-source CONSUMER case, closed 2026-09-05.** This document and
`precedent_vendor_engine.py`'s `'source'` kind closed the gap above for a
*source* repo (an individual or shared set) first. A real four-source
consumer (universal + team + individual + repo-local, with
`process/upstream/` and the full `precedent_materialize.py`/
`precedent_resolve.py`/`precedent_sync_views.py` toolchain) needed the same
treatment — TODO.md tracked it as open, named explicitly so "the
source-repo case is solid" was not mistaken for "the consumer case is
solid too." It no longer is: `precedent_vendor_engine.py`'s `'consumer'`
kind (same script, same seed/status/refresh/fresh subcommands, a larger
CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES list) closes it, piloted against a real private
consumer repo. See
[`INSTALL.md`](../INSTALL.md)'s §0 step 1 and its "Keep the vendored engine
current (consumer repos)" step under §2 for the consumer-repo procedure,
and `tools/verify_harness.py`'s `check_vendor_engine_consumer_case()` for
the fixture proving the whole four-source pipeline actually runs through a
consumer's own vendored copy, the same rigor
`check_bootstrap_source_engine_is_functional()` applies to the source-set
case documented above.

## The procedure

### For an individual set

1. **The name is not a choice: an individual set is always called
   `precedent-individual`**, in that person's own account, which already
   namespaces it. Say so before the person creates anything — the naming
   convention is [practices/source-naming.md](../practices/source-naming.md),
   the reasoning is in [spec/SOURCE_NAMING.md](SOURCE_NAMING.md), and
   [tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py](../tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py)
   refuses any other `--name` before it creates anything, and
   [tools/precedent_resolve.py](../tools/precedent_resolve.py) refuses a
   source declared under one.
2. Create a **private** repository under the person's own account. If the
   session has the access to do this itself (a GitHub App/token scoped for
   repo creation), do it directly; otherwise hand the person the exact
   command (`gh repo create <name> --private`) or the exact click-path
   (github.com → **New repository** → private → no template).
3. Run:
   ```
   python3 tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py --level individual \
       --name <name> --dest <local clone path>
   ```
4. `cd` into the destination, `git init` (if step 2's repo creation didn't
   already leave a clone), commit everything, add the remote from step 2,
   push.
5. Either pass `--write-user-config true` on the bootstrap command (step 3)
   to write `~/.config/precedent/config.json` directly, or copy the printed
   snippet there by hand. **Never** write this into any shared project's
   own tracked files — see `precedent_resolve.py`'s own header for why
   that's refused outright, not just discouraged. On a machine where
   `$HOME` doesn't persist between sessions (Claude Code Remote/Web), skip
   straight to step 5b below instead — a config written by hand here would
   just be gone next session.
5b. **On a hosted/ephemeral session, also wire the session-start hook** —
   `--write-session-hook <consuming project path> --repo-url <this set's
   real git remote, from step 4>` on the same bootstrap command — or, for a
   set that already exists, run it with **no `--dest`** and those two flags
   plus `--level individual --name`, which writes the hook and creates or
   touches nothing else. (That second form only became possible on
   2026-09-06: `--dest` was required either way, so "run it again against an
   already-bootstrapped set" meant force-overwriting the set to get a hook,
   and BestPractice itself therefore had none.) This instantiates
   [`templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/individual-source-bootstrap.sh.template`](../templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/individual-source-bootstrap.sh.template)
   into that project's `.claude/hooks/precedent-individual-bootstrap.sh`,
   delegating to
   [`tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py`](../tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py) —
   see that file's own module docstring, and
   [`practices/session-bootstrap.md`](../practices/session-bootstrap.md)'s
   Story, for why this hook's own attempt, by itself, structurally cannot
   succeed on a fresh session: its repo-read access is granted by the
   agent's own `add_repo` call, made in the agent's own turn, and a
   `SessionStart` hook runs *entirely to completion* before that turn
   starts — not a race the hook might win with enough tries, an ordering
   it cannot win even once. So the consuming project's instructions file
   still needs the standing `add_repo`-at-session-start instruction
   ([INSTALL.md step 9](../INSTALL.md#1-install-into-a-dependent-repo),
   [spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md)
   step 4) alongside this hook — what actually saves the session is
   `tools/precedent_resolve.py`'s own lazy self-heal re-invoking this same
   hook later, from inside the agent's own turn, after that instruction has
   already run.
   **Where the environment carries `PRECEDENT_GIT_TOKEN` and
   `PRECEDENT_SOURCE_BASE_URL` ([PER_MACHINE_SETUP.md](../documentation/PER_MACHINE_SETUP.md)), none of that
   ordering applies**: git has the credential before the first turn, so the
   hook's own single attempt succeeds at `SessionStart` and no `add_repo`
   is involved. That is the durable route; the `add_repo` dance is the
   per-session fallback (practice: `durable-fix`).
   **A PRACTICE SET is one of the projects this is written into**, since
   2026-09-13 — `bootstrap()` calls it for every new set with no
   `--repo-url` at all, so the set derives its account from
   `$PRECEDENT_SOURCE_BASE_URL` and names nobody in a tracked file. This
   document said "*not* the individual set's own repo" until then; the
   exclusion was a dependency (the hook execs an engine file a set could not
   vendor) described as a decision, and it cost every session rooted in a
   set its individual practices. A set has no second route to this hook the
   way a consumer does — `precedent_resolve.py`'s lazy self-heal is
   `CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES`-only — so in a set the `SessionStart` wiring is
   the only thing that ever runs it.
5c. **If the project already carries someone else's hook, do not add a
   second one — set `PRECEDENT_INDIVIDUAL_REPO` to your own set's URL.**
   The hook is committed to a *shared* project, but an individual set
   belongs to one person, so the account baked in when it was instantiated
   is right for whoever installed it and wrong for every other person on
   that project. The instantiated hook reads `PRECEDENT_INDIVIDUAL_REPO`
   first and falls back to the baked-in default, so each person points it
   at their own account through their environment — on Claude Code Remote,
   the environment's own variable configuration — while the tracked file
   stays one file with one default. The *name* is deliberately not
   overridable: [practices/source-naming.md](../practices/source-naming.md)
   fixes it as the same string in every person's own account, so only the
   account can legitimately differ. (Added 2026-09-06, when this repo
   installed its own hook and baked in the one individual set that exists
   here — correct for its owner, wrong for the second maintainer, and
   nothing was going to say so.)
5d. **Fill in `identity.json`, and ask the person for every value it needs
   rather than inferring one.** `name`, `email` and `timezone` a session can
   often read off the account or the container; **`pronouns` it cannot, and
   must not try to** — a name does not carry them
   ([practices/declared-pronouns.md](../practices/declared-pronouns.md)).
   Ask, in the same breath as the rest of the fill-in, and write the pair the
   person gives you (`he/him`, `she/her`, `they/them`). An unfilled
   `timezone` silently downgrades the commit-identity check to a guess; an
   unfilled `pronouns` silently falls back to they/them for someone who may
   have wanted otherwise and was never asked. **`register` (2026-09-14) is
   the third of the same shape**: how technical their replies should be, in
   their own words — nothing else can tell, on purpose
   ([practices/technical-describes-people.md](../practices/technical-describes-people.md)).
   Unfilled, a shared-level default may decide it for them. `--verify` reports
   all three.
   **`relayed_authorization` (2026-09-14) is the same shape and also has to be
   asked**: the skeleton ships `"refused"`, which is a real answer rather than
   a placeholder, so nothing will ever report it as unfilled — and a person
   who would have said `"accepted"` pays a second approval on every
   cross-repository handoff without ever being offered the choice
   ([practices/relayed-authorization.md](../practices/relayed-authorization.md)).
6. Fill in `leak-blocklist.txt` with the person's own private terms, then
   `export PRECEDENT_LEAK_BLOCKLIST=<path>` and
   `git config precedent.requireVocabulary true` in every shared project
   they work in.
7. Delete `practices/example-starter-<level>.md` once a real first practice
   replaces it.

### For a shared set

A shared set is any set declared by more than one repository — a team's
house rules, or a subject system (a filing pipeline, a presentation kit)
used by whoever does that kind of work. Same shape as the individual case,
with two differences: the repo is created once per set (not per person),
and it needs at least one approver at creation time.

1. **The name is a slug, chosen once**, lowercase and hyphenated, naming
   the subject rather than who works on it — a roster-shaped name is stale
   the moment a third person joins, and renaming a set breaks every
   consumer's attribution. The bootstrap tool writes it into the set's
   `precedent-source.json`, which is where its identity lives; the
   repository may be called anything (declare `repo` in the consumer when
   it differs). Say this before the repository is created; see
   [practices/source-naming.md](../practices/source-naming.md).
2. Create a **private** repository, shared with the team's members as
   collaborators. Same access caveat as step 2 above.
3. Run:
   ```
   python3 tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py --level shared \
       --name <name> --dest <local clone path> \
       --approver "Full Name:github-handle" [--visibility public]
   ```
   (`--visibility public` when the repository will be public; it defaults
   to private, and the set's `precedent-source.json` records it.
   Comma-separate multiple `name:handle` pairs to seed more than one
   approver at creation — still fine per
   [PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md's Stage 4](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md#stage-4--approval-by-level):
   "whoever creates a team set is its first approver. No ceremony.")
4. `cd` into the destination, `git init`/commit/push, same as the
   individual case.
5. Wire it into the **consuming project's own tracked `precedent.json`**
   (this one *is* meant to be shared — everyone on the project reads it):
   either pass `--write-repo-config <project root>` on the bootstrap
   command, or add the printed `"sources"` entry by hand, per
   [INSTALL.md step 9](../INSTALL.md#1-install-into-a-dependent-repo).
6. On a hosted/ephemeral session where nothing under the project's git
   checkout persists between sessions, wire the sibling-checkout access
   the same way [spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md)'s
   step 4 already documents for an existing shared source — this is the
   identical gap, not a new one.
7. Fill in `leak-blocklist.txt` and `approvers.json` for real, delete
   `practices/example-starter-<level>.md` once a real first practice replaces it.
8. **For a shared set, run `python3 tools/build_codeowners.py`** and commit
   the `CODEOWNERS` it writes. `approvers.json` is the declaration;
   `CODEOWNERS` is what actually makes GitHub require an approver's review,
   and until it exists the approver list enforces nothing. Re-run it every
   time `approvers.json` changes; never hand-edit the generated file. (An
   individual set skips this — it has no `approvers.json`, and one person
   is the whole approval mechanism. The tool says so and exits 0 rather
   than failing, so running it there is harmless.)

## What this does not close

- **Repo creation itself stays a human/session step**, per the "what the
  tool does not do" section above — this document does not pretend
  otherwise.
- **This is not [`spec/PHASE6_BRIEF.md`](PHASE6_BRIEF.md) item 2** (wiring
  the full candidate/proposal pipeline — `precedent_candidate.py`,
  `precedent_promote.py`, `precedent_land.py` — into a consuming repo).
  That item is about *proposing new practices upward* once a set already
  exists; this document is about the set existing in the first place. A
  freshly bootstrapped set works today with direct edits (as
  `documentation/examples/practice-set/` already shows) — the creation-pipeline tooling
  is a separate, still-open piece of work.
- **Not rehearsed against a real, brand-new external adopter yet** — the
  harness checks (`check_bootstrap_source_produces_resolvable_set` proves
  the tool's *content* output resolves cleanly against a synthetic consumer
  repo; `check_bootstrap_source_engine_is_functional` proves the *engine*
  half is real and working, not just present — both in
  `tools/verify_harness.py`) prove the tool's output is sound; neither
  proves the full human-in-the-loop procedure above reads well to someone
  who has never seen Precedent before. Worth a real rehearsal the same way
  [spec/PHASE6_BRIEF.md](PHASE6_BRIEF.md) item 4 flags for the loader
  install path generally.
