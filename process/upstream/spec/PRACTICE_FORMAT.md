# The Practice File Format

This is the format [`tools/split_practices.py`](../tools/split_practices.py) converts BestPractice's
[`PRACTICES.md`](../PRACTICES.md) into, and the format any future practice (universal, team, or
individual) is authored in. It implements
[PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md)'s "The Practice File"
section. Read that first; this document only covers where this
implementation had to make a call the plan's own illustrative example didn't
settle, and says so plainly rather than presenting those calls as if they
were already decided.

## The Shape

One file per practice, at `practices/<slug>.md`:

### Field order — one order, written down in code and checked

**The fields above are listed in the one order a practice file uses.** The
order itself lives in code, as `FIELD_ORDER` in
[`tools/frontmatter_yaml.py`](../tools/frontmatter_yaml.py), and this example
is held to it: `python3 tools/precedent_check.py --only
frontmatter-field-order` reports any practice out of that order, any field
the list doesn't name, and this example drifting from the constant. **To
fix a file, run `python3 tools/frontmatter_yaml.py --fix-order`.** It moves
whole fields and changes nothing else: values, comments and the padding
that aligns them stay byte for byte. A new field goes into `FIELD_ORDER`
and this example in the same change.

Why it is checked: on 2026-09-26 a handoff message told a practice set to
put the new `ships:` field "under applies_to", and the set followed the
message rather than this example. That day 49 of 151 practices here were
out of order, and every set had some. Morgan ruled that this order stands.
The check is advisory until the sets have taken the engine update and run
the fixer, so that none of them turns red on an update BestPractice can't
fix for them.

`source_rule_unlabeled: true` appears only on practices 47-52, which open on
bare prose in the original numbered catalogue.
[`split_practices.py`](../tools/split_practices.py)'s rebuild reads it so
that it doesn't add a `**Rule.**` label those practices never had.

### `index_required` — who still earns a line in the occasion index

The occasion index is loaded **in full by every session before it does any
work**, so a line in it is paid for on every turn. A practice that already has
a channel does not need one: a real `applies_to` glob fires through
`precedent_paths.py` when the file is edited, and a `gates:` entry fires
through `precedent_gate.py` at the moment it names. `build_views.py` therefore
**omits a practice from the index when it declares either one**, and the
generated block says so and points at `precedent_show.py --index-omitted`.

Two things are never omitted:

- **`applies_to: ["**"]` with no gate.** That glob matches everything and so
  routes nothing; the index is the practice's only channel, and dropping the
  line would un-route the rule silently.
- **A spoken trigger** — something the *person* says. Neither channel can
  reach one: a glob needs a file, and every gate moment
  (`merge`/`review`/`push`/`reply`) arrives at the **end** of the work the
  phrase was meant to redirect. `Go merge` is the worked case, and its own
  history is the citation: while its definition sat in a private set a session
  could not read, one went and asked what the phrase meant — the exact
  interruption the phrase exists to prevent.

A `command:` is a spoken trigger by construction and needs no extra field.
Anything else that is spoken sets **`index_required: true`**.
`tools/precedent_check.py --only index-required-is-declared` reads occasion
text for the shapes a spoken trigger takes and fails any practice that looks
like one and has not declared the field either way — so the judgment is made
**once, by a person, in the practice file**, rather than re-guessed by a
regular expression at every build. Setting **`index_required: false`** records
the opposite finding: this reads as spoken, and the glob or gate really does
route it.

## Rule
...

## Detail
...                               # added at phase 3 -- see below

## Why
...

## Story
...                               # empty in every phase-1 file -- see below

## Install
...                               # not in the plan's own example -- see below
```

[`tools/precedent_show.py`](../tools/precedent_show.py) is the one code path that reads these files; per
the plan's own "Loading a Practice Means Loading Its Rule, Not Its File",
nothing else should open a `practices/*.md` file directly once this exists.

## Two Places This Implementation Goes Beyond The Plan's Illustrative Example

The plan's own frontmatter example and three-section body (Rule/Why/Story)
is illustrative, not a complete spec — building the actual converter against
BestPractice's real 52 practices turned up two gaps a real implementation
has to resolve one way or another. Both are phase-1 judgment calls, made
and recorded here rather than silently decided; both are reversible.

**1. A fourth section, `## Install`.** *(A fifth, `## Detail`, followed at
phase 3 — see [The Rule/Detail Split](#the-ruledetail-split-phase-3).)* BestPractice's own catalogue is
Rule + Why + Install, in every one of its 52 practices — "Install" is how a
dependent repo actually installs the practice: template paths, tool names,
wiring instructions. The plan's example has nowhere for that text to go.
Dropping it would violate the plan's own no-invented-content rule for the
converter (Migration, "The Converter": "the converter may move and drop
text, never invent it" — dropping is allowed, but dropping the single most
actionable part of every practice is not a reasonable reading of that
license) and would make "the catalogue regenerates byte-identically"
(Sequence, phase 1's done-when) unachievable, since the original file has
nothing else in it. So: `## Install` is a fourth section here, on-demand
like Why and Story. Whether it belongs in the *long-run* format, folded into
`checked_by`/a future installer command, or kept as prose, is a real
open question for phase 2 or 3 — flagging it here rather than presenting it
as settled.

**2. `## Story` is present but empty, in all 52 files, for now.** *(Superseded
by the phase-1.5 editorial pass — see [The Editorial Re-Split](#the-editorial-re-split-phase-15)
below. 19 of the 52 now carry a real Story. The reasoning recorded here is kept
because it explains why phase 1 stopped where it did.)* The
plan's Rule/Why/Story split asks for a second split beyond the mechanical
one: separating the *incident* (Story) from the *reasoning* (Why) within
what BestPractice calls "Why" — and the plan itself describes that step as
"LLM-assisted and human-reviewed, once per practice" (Migration, "The
Converter"). Doing that with real care, per practice, for 52 practices,
unreviewed, in one pass risked mischaracterizing exactly the content this
plan exists to preserve faithfully — and the plan's own no-invention rule
is stricter than "roughly right." So this conversion does the mechanical
half only: BestPractice's "Why" text, in full, lands in `## Why` here, and
`## Story` is a real section header with no body — a declared gap, not a
silent one. The token-budget upside of the Rule/Why/Story split does not
depend on Story specifically being populated (see "Loading a Practice Means
Loading Its Rule, Not Its File" in the plan: the resident/on-demand
boundary is Rule vs. everything else) — only the archival and
"question-without-pulling-in-history" benefits of splitting Why from Story
specifically are deferred, not lost. Splitting the 52 Story sections out by
hand, with review, is real follow-on work; it is not blocking for phase 1's
own done-when condition ("Practices are files; the catalogue regenerates
byte-identically; harness passes").

## The Editorial Re-Split (Phase 1.5)

Phase 1's converter routed each paragraph by the bold label that opened it.
That is lossless but not editorial, and it left the plan's headline claim
undelivered:

> "BestPractice's median practice is 38 lines; the instruction inside it is
> three or four. Splitting removes roughly nine tenths of the resident text
> without deleting a word."

After phase 1, `## Rule` was **44%** of the catalogue, not a tenth. Sixteen
practices had Rules over 150 words, the longest ran to 1,340, and the six
practices whose source opens on bare prose (47–52) had their *entire* body
land in `## Rule`, because the label walk never saw a `**Why.**` to leave on.
`## Story` was empty in all 52.

[`tools/resplit_sections.py`](../tools/resplit_sections.py) performs the
second, editorial half — the step the plan describes as "LLM-assisted and
human-reviewed, once per practice". The editorial judgment lives in
[`tools/practice_metadata.json`](../tools/practice_metadata.json)'s sibling,
`tools/section_split.json`, as **references to source paragraphs** rather than
as rewritten text: the tool moves text by reference, so retyping a sentence
slightly differently is not something the mechanism can do, and a reviewer can
read the decisions on their own, apart from their effect. Every one of the 52
is listed explicitly, and every source paragraph must be placed — a paragraph
cannot be dropped by omission.

### What it delivered, and what it did not

| | after phase 1 | after phase 1.5 |
|---|---|---|
| `## Rule` share of the catalogue | 44% | **40%** |
| Practices with a non-empty `## Story` | 0 | **19** |
| Words in `## Story` (never loaded) | 0 | **2,381** |
| Words in `## Why` (loaded only to question a practice) | 2,437 | **3,752** |

**The plan's "nine tenths" estimate does not hold for this catalogue, and
that is a finding rather than a failure of the pass.** BestPractice's
practices carry far more genuinely *normative* text than the estimate
assumed — numbered policy rules, worked decision procedures, sub-rules with
their own tests. Loading a practice's Rule costs roughly 40% of its file, not
10%. That is still a real saving, and Story and Why now hold 6,100 words that
never enter a working session's context; it is not the saving the plan
advertised.

**The underlying reason is worth carrying into phase 3: the four-section
format has no home for detailed normative elaboration.** A numbered list of
policy rules is not reasoning (`Why`), not an incident (`Story`), and not
wiring (`Install`) — so it stays in `Rule` and keeps `Rule` long. Twenty
practices still have Rules over 150 words for exactly this reason. Either the
format grows a fifth section, or `Rule` is understood as "everything
normative" and the resident budget does the trimming instead. Not decided
here.

*(Decided since: the format grew the fifth section. See
[The Rule/Detail Split](#the-ruledetail-split-phase-3) below.)*

### What the pass may and may not do

Content preservation is enforced, not asserted. See
[`tools/verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py):

- **content preserved sentence-for-sentence** — every sentence of every
  practice, against [`PRACTICES.md`](../PRACTICES.md), in both directions.
- **section content keeps its source order** — text may be re-homed, not
  scrambled.
- **markdown list structure preserved** — the sentence checks normalize
  whitespace, so they cannot see a flattened list; this can.

Byte-identical regeneration was **retired** in this pass, because it cannot
survive a re-split by construction: moving a paragraph from Rule to Why moves
where the rebuild emits the `**Why.**` label, so the diff is non-empty however
faithful the move was. Its content claim is now made more strongly by the
sentence check, and its ordering claim by the source-order check. A check that
fails on correct work gets suppressed, and is then absent when something is
actually wrong. `tools/split_practices.py build --diff` still runs; its diff is
now expected output showing the re-split, not a defect report.

## The Rule/Detail Split (Phase 3)

`## Detail` is the fifth body section, added by
[PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md) v20 and applied here.
It holds **normative operational specifics** — numbered policy rules, worked
procedures, sub-rules with their own tests: text that is binding but is not
needed to decide *whether* the practice applies. Same machinery as the
phase-1.5 pass ([tools/resplit_sections.py](../tools/resplit_sections.py)
over [tools/section_split.json](../tools/section_split.json)), so the
decisions are reviewable as data and the text moves by reference rather than
being retyped.

Two constraints from the plan's phase-3 row governed every decision:

- **`## Rule` must stay loadable on its own.** A session that reads only the
  Rule must know what to *do*, not merely that something applies. This is the
  binding constraint, and it is what stopped three practices from being split
  at all.
- **`## Detail` comes from the same command.** `precedent show SLUG --detail`,
  never a second tool — a second extractor is one more thing to drift from
  [tools/precedent_show.py](../tools/precedent_show.py).

### What it delivered

| | after phase 1 | after phase 1.5 | after phase 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `## Rule` share of the catalogue | 44% | 40% | **28%** |
| Practices with `## Rule` over 150 words | 16 | 20 | **7** |
| Resident block, generated | — | ≈621 tokens | **≈312 tokens** |
| Words in `## Detail` | — | — | **4,347** |

Twenty of the fifty-two practices carry a Detail. The resident block — the
text every session pays for, whatever it is doing — **halved**, which is the
closest this catalogue has come to the plan's "nine tenths" claim and still
short of it.

*(Both figures in this table are scoped to BestPractice's original 52
practices — [`tools/catalogue_stats.py`](../tools/catalogue_stats.py)'s `phase3_snapshot_stats()` — so they
stay a stable record of what phase 3 delivered rather than drifting every
time a later practice is added or an inherited one is deliberately rewritten
([`CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md`](CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md)). The "over 150 words" figure moved from 8 to 7
on 2026-09-01, when `layered-practice-packs`' Rule was shortened as part of
that rewrite. The "carries a Detail" figure moved from 15 to 16, and "Words
in `## Detail`" from 2,253 to 2,778, on 2026-09-05, when `session-bootstrap`
gained a real Detail — see [`CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md`](CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md). It moved again to 17
practices, 3,243 words, on 2026-09-06, when `merge-authorization-keyword`
gained a real Detail (updated once more the same day, same practice, when
its Detail grew a postcondition-check requirement), and to 18 practices,
3,667 words, on 2026-09-10, when `github-setup-disclosed` gained a Detail
carrying the owner-only GitHub settings a first install mentions — 3,785
words later the same day, when that Detail gained the repository's own
visibility and the note on keeping the whole thing short. It moved once more,
to 19 practices and 3,876 words, on 2026-09-11, when
`doc-references-are-links` gained a Detail recording the one exception to its
own relative-link clause — a practice file links what does not travel with it
absolutely (`practice-links-travel`) — and to 20 practices and 4,169 words, on
2026-09-12, when `mistakes-become-rules` gained a Detail explaining the
catalogue lookup its proportionality guard now requires. It moved again, to 21
practices and 4,347 words, on 2026-09-13, when `environment-gotchas` gained a
Detail saying when a gotchas section should split into an index plus a record,
and what the index line has to carry to stay findable. (The table cell and the
sentence above it were carried forward from the 2026-09-10 value at the
2026-09-11 move and are corrected here.) Only the two figures
[`tools/catalogue_stats.py`](../tools/catalogue_stats.py) prints an anchor for — the Rule-share-derived
counts, not the raw word totals — are mechanically checked against this
table; the word-count cells are updated by hand alongside them.)*

*(These are the figures after the review pass described in
[What a Reader Caught That No Check Did](#what-a-reader-caught-that-no-check-did)
below, which reverted two splits. The first pass reported 27%, 7, and
seventeen.)*

### The five practices that could not be split, and why that is a finding

The mechanism moves text; it cannot write text, because the no-invented-content
rule forbids it. So a practice can only be split where the source already
has a seam. Five do not:

| slug | Rule words | why it is irreducible |
|---|---|---|
| `permutation-frontier-column` | 358 | The framing paragraph ends *"Three rules:"* and the three rules are one markdown list, which cannot be sliced without flattening it. Rule alone would say a table is being built and stop. |
| `verify-decomposition` | 329 | Names two failure modes. With the fixes for the first in Detail, the Rule diagnosed it — *"the tell is a headline number that survived several passes"* — and then prescribed nothing. Reverted by the review pass below. |
| `mistakes-become-rules` | 228 | One 171-word paragraph in which every sentence is an instruction — root-cause it, encode at the strongest rung, discuss the judgment call — plus a proportionality guard that gates *whether the rule fires at all*. Moving the guard to Detail would leave a Rule that mints a practice for every slip, which is the failure the plan opens by diagnosing. |
| `scripts-assert-properties` | 227 | Its closing paragraph is a **scope gate** — which scripts to instrument, and that scripts owning their numbers end to end need nothing. Detail is defined as what is not needed to decide whether a practice applies, and a scope gate is exactly that. Reverted by the review pass below. |
| `build-buy-decompose` | 224 | The second of its two moves defines the ownership/capability distinction that the closing instruction depends on; moving either half leaves the other dangling. Only the embedded origin anecdote could be re-homed. |

**This is a property of the source text, not of the pass.** BestPractice's
practices were written as continuous prose, and a seam only exists where the
author happened to leave one. Splitting the remaining seven would mean
writing a new lead-in sentence — which is exactly the invention the converter
is forbidden to do, and which would break the sentence-for-sentence check
that makes the whole conversion trustworthy. Doing it deliberately, as an
authored edit reviewed against the source, is real work; it is not this
pass's work, and pretending the mechanism could have done it would
misdescribe why the number stopped where it did.

### What a Reader Caught That No Check Did

The seventeen splits were made in one pass, and then read back — each `## Rule`
on its own, as `precedent show SLUG` returns it, with nothing else loaded.
**Three were wrong.** Every check in the harness passed on all three, and the
content-preservation net was never in question: nothing was lost, invented or
reordered in any of them. What was wrong was the judgment the net cannot see.

| practice | what the Rule said on its own | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `verify-decomposition` | Named two failure modes, gave the tell for both, and the prescribed fix for only one. A session reading it would diagnose the first and be told nothing to do. | Reverted |
| `scripts-assert-properties` | Lost its scope gate to Detail, so a session reading only the Rule would instrument every script rather than the ones that re-derive another owner's quantity. | Reverted |
| `layered-practice-packs` | Its decision rule routes a rule to *"the pack"* — and the sentence defining what a practice pack **is** had moved to Detail. The Rule used a term it never defined. | Definition restored to Rule; only the routing aside stays in Detail |

**The line that came out of it, and that the remaining splits were re-checked
against:** `## Detail` may hold sub-rules and elaboration; it may **not** hold
anything needed to decide *whether, or how widely, the practice applies*. That
is the plan's own definition of Detail read strictly — *"not needed to decide
whether the practice applies"* — and it is what separates
`scripts-assert-properties`' scope gate (belongs in Rule) from
`reply-links-files`' rendered-view sub-rule (belongs in Detail).

**One of the three had a mechanical signature and now has a check.** A Rule
ending on a colon has had its payload moved out and announces a list it does
not contain; `check_rule_is_self_contained` in
[tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py) fails on it, and was
verified by re-applying the split that would have dangled. The other two —
a scope gate that moved, a term defined only in Detail — are judgments about
meaning, and **there is no check for them**. They needed a reader. That is
worth saying plainly rather than implying the harness now covers this.

### One tension worth recording rather than smoothing over

`verify-postcondition` is the catalogue's most-missed resident practice
([What Phase 2 Measured](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md#what-phase-2-measured):
judged applicable twice, named by the full-catalogue control **zero** times),
and this pass moved its two most concrete parts — the pipeline-exit-status
trap and the explicit-target trap — out of the resident Rule and into Detail.
The split is correct by the plan's rule (they are elaboration; the Rule stands
alone without them) and it is the single largest contributor to halving the
resident block. It may also make that practice's misses worse.

Phase 2's own measurement is the reason not to guess either way: **residency
did not produce compliance for this practice at any catalogue size**, so
keeping 117 more words resident had no measured benefit to protect. The
answer the plan points at is phase 4 — `verify-postcondition` carries
`checked_by: null` and is on phase 4's starting queue. Recorded here so that
whoever runs the routing eval after phase 4 knows this changed underneath it.

## Status

**The format never enumerated the legal values of `status:` until version 4.**
The shape block showed `status: active` and nothing said what else was
allowed — which is part of how the meaning drifted, and is recorded here
rather than quietly fixed.

There are three, and they answer different questions with different evidence:

| `status:` | Means | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| `active` | The rule is in force here. | no `in_force_at:` |
| `deduplicated` | The **copy** here is redundant. The rule itself is fully in force, from another source or from the engine. | `in_force_at:` naming a slug that **resolves in force** (directly, or through another deduplicated stub's own `in_force_at:`), or the literal `engine` |
| `retired` | Nobody wants this rule anywhere. | `in_force_at: none`, plus a `## Story` line saying why |

**`retired` here is about a RULE, and the file stays.** A practice marked
`retired` keeps its file, its `## Story` and its reasoning — the loader
declines to put it in force, and [`precedent_show.py`](../tools/precedent_show.py) prints it with a
banner saying so. Nothing deletes it, and being able to re-read a withdrawn
rule years later is the point.

That matters because two neighbouring things in this system used to be
called "retired" too, and one of them meant the opposite fate for the file:

| Sense | Where | The file |
|---|---|---|
| a **practice** is retired | this table | **kept** |
| **vocabulary** is retired | [migration-scrubs-vocabulary](../practices/migration-scrubs-vocabulary.md), `process/retired_vocabulary.json` (scanned by `retired-words`, with the engine's own `tools/our_language.json` list) | a banned word, no file of its own |
| a **mechanism** is *decommissioned* | [decommission-deletes-files](../practices/decommission-deletes-files.md), `process/decommissioned_paths.json` | **deleted** |

The third was called "retired" until 2026-09-07, when Morgan read a
migration record and asked, reasonably, whether practices had just been
thrown away. They had not — but nothing in the vocabulary distinguished
the two, and by then [`tools/precedent_retire.py`](../tools/precedent_retire.py) (proposes a status
change, never acts) was sitting beside `tools/precedent_retire_path.py`
(deletes files). The mechanism sense was renamed to **decommission**
because it was eight days old and narrowly scoped, while `status: retired`
is load-bearing across this schema and eight tools — and because "retired"
is the right word for a rule withdrawn but remembered.

### `expires:` — an optional end, in one field, in two shapes

**Almost every practice has no expiry and never will**, which is why the
field is optional and defaults to `null`. It is for the minority of rules
that are true *for now* and everybody knows it: a temporary constraint, a
workaround for something being fixed elsewhere, a rule scoped to one phase
of a project.

One field takes both shapes, and which one you wrote is decided by whether
it parses as a date:

| Shape | Example | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **A date** | `expires: "2027-03-01"` | Enforced. Once the date passes and the practice is still `active`, [tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py) fails until somebody decides. |
| **A condition** | `expires: "when precedent-beta-v01 is merged into main"` | Never auto-evaluated. [tools/very_deep_check.py](../tools/very_deep_check.py) lists it every run so a person judges whether it has happened. |

**An expiry never withdraws a rule on its own, and that is the whole design
constraint.** A practice past its date stays `active` and stays binding —
the field makes NOISE, it does not change `status`. A rule that quietly
switched itself off would be worse than a stale one: the stale rule is at
least still being followed, while the silent one has stopped protecting
anything and nobody has been told. So an expiry forces a decision and
refuses to make it for you.

**Why a condition is deliberately not evaluated.** No general predicate can
read an arbitrary English sentence. A check that tried would fail in one of
two directions — withdrawing a live rule because it guessed the condition
had been met, or reporting an expired one as current — and both are worse
than printing the sentence in front of a person once per deep check. Some
conditions *are* individually checkable, and one of those can grow its own
check later; the field does not pretend to be that check.

**Writing a good condition:** name an observable event, not a feeling.
*"when precedent-beta-v01 is merged into main"* is something anyone can go
and look at. *"when the migration settles down"* is not, and will still be
sitting there in a year.

`in_force_at:` is the field that did not exist before version 4, and its
absence is the defect the other two rows exist to fix. `supersedes:` points
*backwards*, from a replacement to what it replaced. Nothing pointed
*forwards*: `status:` recorded that a rule stopped applying here but never
whether anything replaced it, so the forwarding address lived only as English
prose in `## Story`, which no tool reads. "Deduplicated safely" and "dropped
and forgotten" were therefore indistinguishable to every check in the system.

### Why the vocabulary changed, which is not a labelling quibble

Every use of the old `status: retired` across this ecosystem, at the point
the rename landed:

| Practice | What actually happened | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `bestpractice-sync` | copy dropped; rule in force at individual | correct — a **deduplication** |
| `header-caps` | copy dropped; rule in force at universal | correct — a **deduplication** |
| `deep-check` | dropped outright, "very-deep-check covers it" | **wrong; reversed 2026-09-06** |

Every correct use was a deduplication, and the only attempt at a genuine
retirement was the mistake. **The word invited it.** "Retire" sounds like a
judgement about whether a rule is still wanted, so the question a session
asks itself becomes *"does something similar exist?"* — which is answerable
by reading two files and feeling that they rhyme. That is exactly what
happened to `deep-check`: a routine per-commit check was dropped on the
authority of an unrelated, deliberately-rare cross-repo audit, because the
two resembled each other and resemblance was accepted as coverage.

"Deduplicate" cannot be answered by resemblance. It forces the only question
that matters: **what is the surviving copy, and does it resolve in force?**
[`tools/verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py)'s
`check_status_contract` answers it mechanically rather than taking the
mover's word for it.

### Retirement is demoted, not deleted

Two real cases cannot be expressed as deduplication, and both have occurred,
so `retired` stays — rare, loud, and no longer reachable by "something
similar exists":

- **Genuinely obsolete.** A rule about a tool you stopped using has no
  duplicate anywhere. This is the case the word actually fits, and it is what
  [`tools/precedent_retire.py`](../tools/precedent_retire.py) exists to find
  (never cited **and** unreachable). Nothing has hit it yet.
- **Absorbed into the mechanism.** RepoPersonalPreferences' `bestpractice-wins` said the personal
  layer beats the generic one; it was dropped because precedence became a
  property of the resolver. There is no successor *slug* — the successor is
  code.

**The second is filed under `deduplicated`, with `in_force_at: engine`, not
under `retired`.** That was a deliberate call and the reasoning is worth
keeping: the rule is *fully in force*, merely enforced by code instead of by
prose. Filing an in-force rule under a status that means "nobody wants this
rule anywhere" would reproduce, one level down, exactly the conflation this
vocabulary exists to remove. So `deduplicated` means "in force elsewhere, and
here is where" — whether *elsewhere* is another practice or the engine — and
`retired` keeps a single legal value, `none`, which is what makes it loud.

### Migrating a record written under the old vocabulary

A practice carrying a non-active status with **no** `in_force_at:` predates
this field. It does not say which of the two things it meant, and nothing can
work that out from the file alone — so no tool in this engine treats it as
either. [`tools/precedent_show.py`](../tools/precedent_show.py) marks it as
*not in force here* and explicitly declines to call it a withdrawal;
`status_contract_violation` reports it as unmigrated rather than malformed.

[`tools/precedent_migrate_status.py`](../tools/precedent_migrate_status.py)
does the migration, and it is vendored into every practice set
([`ENGINE_FILES`](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)) because the legacy
records live in the private sets, not in this catalogue. It reports by
default and writes only what it is told to write:

```
# always start here -- report only, writes nothing
python3 tools/precedent_migrate_status.py --repo . --against ../precedent-individual

# then record the decisions, one flag per practice
python3 tools/precedent_migrate_status.py --repo . --against ../precedent-individual \
    --set header-caps=headline-capitalization --apply
```

It proposes only what it can establish: a practice whose **same slug** is
active in one of the `--against` sources. Anything else comes back
**UNDETERMINED**, with the practice's own `## Story` printed as evidence —
because the old convention put the forwarding address there in prose — and
printed rather than parsed, since a regex over prose is a guess wearing a
mechanism's clothes.

**A renamed successor is undetermined by construction, and that is the
point.** `header-caps`'s rule survives at universal as
`headline-capitalization`; nothing mechanical connects the two names. A
migration willing to guess there would re-introduce exactly the
resemblance-based reasoning this rename exists to remove — so it refuses,
and a person names the target. It also refuses a named target that is not
active in any source, and refuses `--set ...=none` on a practice with an
empty `## Story`.

Because [`verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py) is deliberately **not** vendored, this tool is
also the only compliance signal a practice set has for this: it exits
non-zero while any legacy record remains, and
[`precedent_vendor_engine.py`](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)'s
`refresh` prints a notice naming them — the moment the new vocabulary
arrives is the moment to say so.

### An unknown status fails closed

[`tools/build_views.py`](../tools/build_views.py)'s `is_in_force` tests for
`active` rather than testing against the list of known statuses. A practice
carrying a status this engine does not recognize — a typo, or a newer
engine's vocabulary — is therefore **not** loaded, and is reported by the
harness. Failing the other way would load a rule nobody here can vouch for.

## `applies_to_why` and `gates_why` -- the routing reason, in the practice itself

**Every on-demand practice says why its `applies_to` is what it is**, in
`applies_to_why`: the path that identifies its distinguishing condition, or
why it stays at `**` and which channel reaches it instead (the occasion
index, a gate, a check). `gates_why`, optional, says why the practice fires
at the moment it names. `precedent_check.py --only routing-reason` refuses
an on-demand practice with no `applies_to_why`, file by file, so the refusal
comes at `pre-staging`.

**Until 2026-09-29 these reasons lived in a second file**,
`tools/routing_scope.json`, which had to list every practice by hand. That
list caused the failure its test existed to catch: a new practice arrived
without an entry, and a deleted one left an entry behind that nothing
noticed. By then the file's copy of `gates` had also drifted from the
practice files on fourteen practices, because nothing compared them. Moving
the reason into the practice removed the second copy, so there is nothing
left to keep in step (Morgan, 2026-09-29: prevent what caused it, not only
check for it later; practice: [upstream-fix](../practices/upstream-fix.md)).
`tools/routing_scope.json` keeps only the closed gate vocabulary.

A glob is justified only where the path identifies the practice's
**distinguishing** condition, not merely a necessary one: "a rule is being
written" is necessary for `volatile-rules-carry-dates` and not
distinguishing; "a new rule is being written" is distinguishing for
`cite-the-incident`.

## `gates` (Phase 4)

Not in the plan's frontmatter example, and load-bearing for the channel the
plan *does* name. **Gate-triggered** is the fourth loading channel —
*"Runbook steps cite slugs; reaching the step loads them. A merge loads
exactly the merge practices, at the moment of merging."* — and nothing carried
the association between a practice and a moment until this field.

```
gates:       ["merge"]
```

**Why a moment cannot be a glob, which is the whole argument for the field.**
Phase 4's routing pass gave a narrower `applies_to` to every on-demand
practice with a genuine path locus and recorded the reason for every one that
kept `**` (then in `tools/routing_scope.json`; since 2026-09-29 in each
practice's own `applies_to_why`, below). Twenty-six kept it, and the most common reason was the same: **the practice fires at a
moment, not in a place.** `merge-runbook` fires when merging.
`mistakes-become-rules` fires when a review turns up a defect. No glob reaches
either, however well written, and the plan forbids widening the occasion index
to compensate.

Four rules govern the field, all enforced by
[tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py)'s `check_gate_channel`:

- **The vocabulary is closed.** Gate names are declared once, in
  `tools/routing_scope.json`, with the moment each one is. A practice naming
  an unknown gate fails the harness — a typo in a gate name would otherwise
  register a practice to a moment nobody reaches.
- **No gate may be empty.** A gate with no practices prints nothing and exits
  0, which is indistinguishable from a gate that legitimately had nothing to
  say. [tools/precedent_gate.py](../tools/precedent_gate.py) refuses one by
  name, and the harness refuses one in the vocabulary.
- **Every gate resolves.** The harness runs the command for each gate as a
  subprocess and requires every registered slug in the output.
- **At least one gate is wired to something automatic.** The `push` gate is
  invoked by [templates/hooks/pre-push](../templates/hooks/pre-push), so it
  fires whether or not anyone remembers it. The harness fails if that wiring
  is removed.

**What this channel does not settle**, stated here rather than left to be
discovered: reach is deterministic *given that the gate is invoked*. Three of
the four gates are invoked by a runbook step or the standing instruction,
which is a session remembering to — the same weakness the occasion index has.
Only `push` is wired. Whether a practice reaches a session through `merge`,
`review` or `reply` is therefore a wiring question, and phase 6's consumer-repo
integration is where the remaining three get hooks.

**The routing eval cannot see any of this.** It replays twenty commits against
the resident block, the occasion index and the path channel; a gate fires at a
moment a commit does not record. No recall figure is attributable to this
channel, and none is claimed.

## `checked_by` — What The Script It Names Must Do

The field takes a path to a script (`tools/checks/check_x.py`) or `null`.
What the format never said, and a session went looking for on 2026-09-13
before concluding nothing documented it, is **what that script owes its
caller**. It does — in
[tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py)'s `_external_checks`
docstring, which is the code that runs it and therefore the authority. It is
restated here because this is where somebody writing one looks first:

| Exit | Means | Reported as |
|---|---|---|
| `0`, printing nothing | clean | PASS |
| `1`, printing the finding | violated | VIOLATION |
| `2` | **could not run** | SKIPPED, never PASS |
| anything else | the script's own bug | ERROR — neither pass nor violation |

Plus: **no arguments**, and **`ROOT` derived from the script's own location**
(`<repo>/tools/checks/check_x.py` → `<repo>`), so it audits the repo it was
materialized *into* rather than the source that published it.

**Exit 2 is the one worth being deliberate about.** A script with nothing to
check — no files in scope, a config the repo has not declared — must exit 2
and say why, not exit 0. Exit 0 on an empty input set is the single failure
this whole module is built against: a scan that checked nothing, reporting
OK. Real sets do both today, and the inconsistency has a cost beyond
tidiness: a plain `for f in check_*.py; do ...; done` loop reads that 2 as a
failure, which cost a session time on 2026-09-13 confirming a pre-existing
skip was not something it had broken. If you wrap these scripts in a loop of
your own, treat 2 as "skipped", not "failed".

### Its test runs in somebody else's repository

A shared or individual check ships with a two-direction test,
`tools/checks/tests/test_<name>.sh`, and the test is materialized along with
the script: **it runs in every consuming repository, against that
repository's tree, not only in the source that wrote it.** Whatever it
assumes about its home layout is an assumption about someone else's.

- **Stage a planted fixture with `git add -f`, never a plain `git add`.** A
  consumer's `.gitignore` may ignore the path — `vendor/` under a dependency
  manager, `build/`, `dist/`, `node_modules/` — and git refuses a plain add
  of an ignored file. On 2026-09-25 exactly this held a test red for days in
  a consuming repository while it passed on every run in its source.
- **Read no `tools/` file a consumer does not receive.** A consumer gets the
  vendored engine, `tools/checks/`, and what practices declare in `ships:`
  (above) — nothing else from the source's `tools/`. A test that copies a
  source-only script fails there; declare the script in the owning
  practice's `ships:`.
- **The source's push check runs the suite a second time shaped like a
  consumer**
  ([tools/precedent_consumer_shape.py](../tools/precedent_consumer_shape.py)
  — git told to ignore what consumers commonly ignore, in a copy of the
  source without its own `tools/`), so both classes of assumption fail at
  home rather than downstream.
- **In a consumer, a failing materialized test is its source's bug.** The
  generated driver names the source for each one; fix and report it there,
  never note it as pre-existing where it merely showed up
  ([two-check-levels](../practices/two-check-levels.md)).

## `ships` — The Files A Practice Owns Besides Its Check

Optional. A JSON list of repository-relative paths:

```
ships:       ["tools/create_word_doc.py"]
```

It names every file the practice owns **besides** its `checked_by` script
and that script's test, which travel on their own: a tool its Rule tells a
session to run, a file its shipped test reads, anything a consumer needs for
the practice to work. Absent, `null` and `[]` all mean "nothing".

**What it does.** [tools/precedent_materialize.py](../tools/precedent_materialize.py)
copies each entry of every practice it materializes to the **same path** in
the consuming repository, the way it copies `tools/checks/`: recorded in
`MANIFEST.json` under `ships`, compared by `--check`, a destination two
sources both claim refused, a copy the manifest never recorded replaced with
a notice, a file no practice ships any more reported and left in place.
Before this field, such a file travelled by "copy it in by hand", which is
how `create-word-doc`'s test went red in a consumer on 2026-09-26: the test
copies `tools/create_word_doc.py`, and nothing had delivered it.

**What an entry may not be** (`build_views.ship_path_problem`, the one
definition every tool asks): absolute, above the repository (`..`), a glob,
under `practices/` or `tools/checks/` (they travel already), a file every
repository keeps its own copy of ([`precedent.json`](../precedent.json),
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), `MANIFEST.json`, a harness `settings.json`), or a vendored engine file.

**Declining one.** A consuming repository that does not want a shipped file
says so in its own `precedent.json`, with a reason, and the sync records the
decline in `MANIFEST.json` instead of delivering the file:

```
"declined_ships": {"tools/create_word_doc.py": "we never export .docx"}
```

An entry with no reason is refused; one naming a file nothing ships warns as
stale.

**What holds a source to it** —
[practice-carries-its-files](../practices/practice-carries-its-files.md):
its check runs in every repository that publishes practices, and refuses a
`ships:` entry the source does not carry, a concrete `applies_to` path
under `tools/` or a `checked_by` script it does not carry, and a shipped test that reads a
source-only `tools/` file (`$ROOT/tools/...`) nobody declares.
[tools/precedent_consumer_shape.py](../tools/precedent_consumer_shape.py)
then runs every shipped test in a copy of the source without its own
`tools/`, so a dependency the static read missed fails at the source's push.
[tools/precedent_move.py](../tools/precedent_move.py) refuses a move whose
destination does not already carry every `ships:` file.

## `index_clause`

Not in the plan's frontmatter example, and load-bearing anyway: the occasion
index is the **only** route to 34 of the 46 on-demand practices, and a
session decides whether to open a practice on the strength of one line.

Phase 2 derived that line — the Rule's first sentence, cut at 90 characters.
**86% of the 46 entries came out truncated mid-thought**, and one ended on a
dangling colon:

```
name-both-sides-of-ledger — When a model charges one party for what another receives — work for kinetic energy, spe...
docs-track-models — Extending practice 19 from *tables* to **every** figure a script computes:
```

The plan's own worked example is not a derived first sentence; it is a
written clause — *"references are links; ≈ not ~"*. So the clause is
authored, one per on-demand practice, and
[`tools/verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py) requires it: present,
**80 characters at most**, finishing its thought, and reading as a table cell
rather than a sentence.

**Count with a tool, never by eye.** Since 2026-09-26
[`tools/build_views.py`](../tools/build_views.py) refuses to write the views
when a clause you wrote or changed is over the limit, and names the file and
its length. That is where a writer finds out. A session had extended one
clause to 81 characters, and the tool rendered it without a word. The only
check that knew the limit was the harness, and a push to `pre-staging` does
not run it. Clauses a practice set already carried over the limit before
that date are not refused until someone edits them. Derivation stays as a fallback so a newly added
practice renders something before its clause is written.

This is metadata for a generated view, not practice text — the
no-invented-content rule governs Rule/Why/Story/Install, which this never
touches.

**Two `occasion` strings were rewritten in the same pass**, for a defect
[spec/LOADER.md](LOADER.md) already names in another practice: an occasion
that describes the *error state* rather than a work moment a session can
recognize is unroutable, because recognizing it means already having avoided
the mistake.

| slug | was | now |
|---|---|---|
| `verify-decomposition` | trusting a model's total without checking its parts | reporting a computed total or a negative feasibility result |
| `search-by-purpose` | concluding that no prior work exists on a question | starting work the repository may already cover |

## `command:` — The Standing Phrases A Practice Defines

**Optional, and empty for all but a dozen practices.** A practice that
defines a standing command — a phrase a person types and every session is
guaranteed to recognize — declares its own trigger phrases here:

```
command:     {"Go merge": "Save the work, publish it, and tell you where it went."}
```

An object mapping **each trigger phrase** to **the plain sentence a person
who is not a developer reads**. Two phrases for one command are two entries
in one object, never two practices: `Booked`, `Go update` and `Approved`
are one rule with several triggers, and splitting them would be the same rule maintained
twice.

It is a registry, not decoration.
[`tools/precedent_vocabulary.py`](../tools/precedent_vocabulary.py) collects
every `command:` field across every resolved source and is what answers the
`Vocabulary` command; the reader-facing table in
[`documentation/DAILY_HABITS.md`](../documentation/DAILY_HABITS.md)
is a generated block built from the same read. Added 2026-09-13, when the
list of commands lived in two hand-maintained copies and neither was
complete ([`practices/vocabulary.md`](../practices/vocabulary.md)).

**The gloss is reader-facing prose**, so
[readers-vocabulary](../practices/readers-vocabulary.md) governs it — not
`index_clause`'s register, which is written for a session deciding whether
to open the file. The two say the same thing to different people, and the
duplication is deliberate.

## `strength:` — How Firmly The Approval Was Given

**Optional, in every source, permanently.** `approved_by:` records *who*
approved a practice and when. It cannot record *how convinced they were*, and
until 2026-09-09 nothing in the format could — so a rule the owner shrugged
at and a rule he fought for arrived in the catalogue looking identical, and
every session afterwards read both as settled.

`strength:` holds one of two words:

| value | means |
|---|---|
| `decided` | they asked for it, chose it from options, or argued and landed here |
| `assented` | it was proposed to them and they did not object |

The rule for choosing between them, including how to read agreement that
arrives as *"let's try it"* rather than as either word, is
[practices/decision-strength.md](../practices/decision-strength.md). The
phrase a person can say to mark one at the moment they give it is
[practices/weak-yes.md](../practices/weak-yes.md).

**Absence means unknown, and is not a defect.** The field was added to a
catalogue whose practices already carried approvals, and **none of them were
backfilled**: deciding today which of last month's "ok"s was enthusiastic is
guessing at someone's state of mind, which is exactly what
[no-invented-specifics](../practices/no-invented-specifics.md) forbids. So an
unmarked practice is legal forever, `tools/precedent_check.py --only
decision-strength` never reports absence, and a session citing an unmarked
approval says what the repository records rather than what the person wanted.

**Writing it out as `null` is also legal**, and is the unknown state said
aloud rather than left to inference. It carries no claim, so the check's
"names an approver" requirement does not apply to it.

**Nothing defaults it.** [tools/precedent_land.py](../tools/precedent_land.py)
takes `--strength` and omits the field when the flag is absent, rather than
writing `decided` — a tool that assumed enthusiasm would manufacture the
endorsement this field exists to stop manufacturing.

## `scope` — which practices travel to every adopter

**Optional; absent means `any-adopter`.** Almost every practice in this
catalogue is written for someone using Precedent in an ordinary repository —
whatever they are actually building. A few are written for someone
developing the ENGINE itself: whether the loader's resident/occasion split
still holds together, whether the routing table's globs still fire, whether
the harness adapters under `templates/harness/` still agree with each
other. Those only make sense inside this repository — an adopter's session
has no `philosophy/` tree, no loader to routing-audit, no sibling harness
copies to keep in sync — and until this field existed, every one of them
still cost every adopter an occasion-index line, forever, for a trigger
that could never fire there.

| `scope:` | Means | Materialized into an adopter? |
|---|---|---|
| `any-adopter` (default) | Applies to anyone running Precedent, whatever they are building | Yes |
| `engine-dev` | Applies only to a session developing or auditing the practice engine itself | No — [tools/precedent_materialize.py](../tools/precedent_materialize.py) drops it |

**This is a materialization-time filter, not a resolution-time one.** The
practice's file, its Rule, its history all stay exactly where they are, in
this repository's own `practices/`, and this repository's own generated
loader block still carries it — a session working ON the engine still needs
`very-deep-check` in its own occasion index. What changes is only what the
materializer copies into a CONSUMING repo's `practices/` directory.
**Nothing is deleted and nothing becomes unreachable**: an
adopter who genuinely wants to run a very deep check attaches this
repository (or asks a session that already has it attached) exactly as they
would today. They just stop paying for a trigger phrase every session there
will never say.

**Set it, don't infer it from `tier` or from level.** A practice can be
`tier: on-demand` and universal-level and still be `engine-dev` scoped —
`scope` is about AUDIENCE (who could ever act on this), `tier` is about
LOADING (resident vs. on-demand), and level is about PRECEDENCE (universal
vs. team vs. individual vs. repo-local). A repo-local practice needs no
`scope` at all: `local/practices/` already never travels to another repo,
by a different mechanism entirely.

**Drafted 2026-09-15**, out of a conversation about why a content-only
adopter's loaded file is dominated by triggers it can never use. **Tagged
`engine-dev` today:** [cross-source-rollout](../practices/cross-source-rollout.md),
[new-hook-joins-the-registry](../practices/new-hook-joins-the-registry.md),
[parallel-artifact-ledger](../practices/parallel-artifact-ledger.md) and
[routing-audit](../practices/routing-audit.md) — each fires only on a
mechanism that exists in this repository, whose engine other sources depend
on. `cross-source-rollout` joined them on 2026-09-15, in the classification
sweep over all 104 universal on-demand practices that found it the one
further clear match. That list is read out of this paragraph by the check
below and compared against the tree, so it cannot go stale silently; it is
the list, not a description of one.

**The rest of the catalogue has been asked the same question once**, in
that 2026-09-15 sweep, and the answer was that everything else describes a
workflow an adopter genuinely uses — writing their own rules, running their
own leak gate, landing their own practices — even where it uses Precedent's
own vocabulary to do it. **That is a reviewed answer, not a standing
licence to sweep**: tagging on resemblance alone is exactly the failure mode
[decision-strength](../practices/decision-strength.md) and
[mistakes-become-rules](../practices/mistakes-become-rules.md) warn about
for a judgment call like this one, so an unreviewed practice keeps its
default (`any-adopter`) rather than being guessed into `engine-dev`.
[very-deep-check](../practices/very-deep-check.md)'s Pass 4 re-asks it of
every universal on-demand practice, so drift gets caught by the standing
mechanism rather than by another manual sweep.

**Two practices were tagged on 2026-09-15 and deliberately untagged on
2026-09-21** — [very-deep-check](../practices/very-deep-check.md) and
[full-practice-audit](../practices/full-practice-audit.md). Each declares a
standing `command:` ("Very deep check", "Practice check"), and `engine-dev`
withholds the practice from a consuming repo's materialized `practices/`:
somebody said the words in their own project, the session had no such
practice, and nothing happened for a reason nobody in that room could see
(commit `8b5aba96`). **A practice that declares a `command:` cannot be
`engine-dev` scoped**, and `vocabulary-reaches-the-consumer` in
[tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py) refuses one that
tries. They carry `scope: any-adopter` in so many words rather than nothing,
because here the default is a decision somebody made, and a blank field
reads as a decision nobody made.

**`scope: null` is not a third value — it is the absent field.** The one
null policy in [tools/split_practices.py](../tools/split_practices.py)'s
`parse_frontmatter_fields` drops a `null` field before any consumer sees
it, for every field in both formats, so `scope: null` and no `scope:` line
are indistinguishable everywhere downstream. **No check can recover the
difference**, which is why the tagged list above is authored here and
compared against the tree rather than inferred from the files alone.

**Mechanically checked since 2026-09-22**, by
`check_scope_field_is_legal_and_matches_this_spec` in
[tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py): every practice's
`scope:` holds one of the two legal values or is absent, no repo-local
practice redundantly declares `engine-dev`, and the tree's `engine-dev`
practices are exactly the ones this section names. It is owed to
[checkable-gets-checked](../practices/checkable-gets-checked.md), and the
gap it closes had already bitten: a 2026-09-21 audit read the two untagged
files above against this section's then-stale list of four, filed the
deliberate untagging as silent drift, and proposed reverting it — which
`vocabulary-reaches-the-consumer` would have refused. **The list going
stale was the defect**, not the tree.

## `source_practice_number`

Not in the plan's frontmatter example, and necessary anyway: the Migration
section's verification harness explicitly requires "citation integrity —
every existing citation resolves, including the 169 by-number `practice N`
references." Slugs are the practice's permanent identity going forward, but
the *existing* catalogue and every existing citation into it are numeric.
This field is the join key that lets [`tools/verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py)'s citation
check, and eventually a real migration tool, resolve `practice 20` to
`mistakes-become-rules`. It is a phase-1/migration-bridging field, not part
of the practice's own identity — a promoted shared or individual practice
minted fresh, with no BestPractice-numbered ancestor, simply won't have one.

It stays mandatory for the 52 practices converted from BestPractice's
numbered catalogue and optional for everything minted after the fork — that
was already the design intent above, stated here as the explicit, settled
policy since the question is a natural one to ask now that slugs are the
citation form everywhere (next section). A `BP23`-style prefixed variant
(folding the provenance into the number itself) was considered and rejected:
the frontmatter key already carries that provenance once, and a bare integer
is what every actual consumer of the field ([`verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py)'s
citation-integrity check, [`split_practices.py`](../tools/split_practices.py)'s sort key) wants — a string
tag would just be a second way to say what the key name already says.

## Citing Other Practices

**Slugs are practices' official identity and their official citation form,
always as a markdown link: `[some-slug](some-slug.md)`.** This was already
true in the plan (`slug: … # permanent identity; cited by name`), but the 52
phase-1 files' own prose had not caught up: they still cited each other the
old way, as bare `practice N` / `practices N and M` text, carried forward
verbatim by the phase-1 converter's own "move, never invent" rule. A
catalogue built to let practices be reordered, split, and retired
independently (this fork's whole reason for moving off fixed numbers — see
[PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md), "Practices cited by
position … making insertion a cross-repo sweep") cannot leave its own
cross-references pointing at position. A pre-phase-5 session (2026-09-01)
swept every `practices/*.md` file and replaced each cross-reference with a
slug link, resolved against the practice's actual content rather than just
its printed number — see
[CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md](CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md) for the full list,
including four pre-existing miscitations the sweep found and fixed.
[`tools/verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py) holds this going
forward with two checks: `check_no_bare_numeric_citations` fails if a bare
`practice N` reappears in body prose, and `check_slug_link_integrity` fails
if a `[slug](slug.md)` link points at a slug that does not exist.

Converting a citation to a link is a real, disclosed content edit relative to
BestPractice's frozen original — it adds words (the slug name) the fidelity
checks below did not count at that frequency — so every affected slug is
registered in [`verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py)'s `AMENDED_POST_CONVERSION` and logged in
[`CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md`](CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md), per that mechanism's own rule that an exemption
must be both declared and actually findable there.

## What's Deliberately Left For Later

- **`added` is `null` for all 52.** Backfilling it means finding, per
  practice, the earliest commit that introduced that practice's text in
  BestPractice's history — the shallow clone this conversion worked from
  (`--depth 1`, to avoid a slow full-history fetch through the session's git
  proxy) has no history to blame against. A full clone and a `git log -S`
  pass per practice would fill this in; not done here because it doesn't
  block phase 1's done-when condition and a shallow fork is the right
  default for day one regardless (Risks: "keep universal practice text as
  close to upstream's wording as possible" says nothing about needing full
  history on disk).
- **`tier` was `on-demand` for all 52 at phase 1; phase 2 curated 6 to
  `resident`** once the budget mechanism existed to enforce the choice —
  see [spec/LOADER.md](LOADER.md) for which six and why. `severity` is
  still `default` for all 52 at phase 2. `severity`'s only real job
  (Severity, Not Ranking) is resolving conflicts between sources at
  different precedence, which does not arise until shared and individual
  sources exist (phase 3) — so `default` for everything is not a
  placeholder guess, it is the correct value until there is a second source
  to conflict with.
- **`checked_by` and narrower `applies_to` are set only where mechanically
  unambiguous** from the original Install text (roughly a dozen of the 52 —
  see `tools/practice_metadata.json`). Every on-demand practice also gets an
  `occasion` string, which alone satisfies the plan's reachability
  requirement (every on-demand practice needs *at least one* of
  `checked_by` / narrow `applies_to` / `occasion`) — so reachability holds
  for all 52 without claiming enforcement accuracy this pass didn't do the
  work to earn.

## A Genuine Upstream Finding

Converting the catalogue mechanically (rather than reading and rewriting
each practice by hand) surfaced a real defect in BestPractice's own
[`PRACTICES.md`](../PRACTICES.md) at the commit this fork is based on (`88ecf7f`): practice
39's body is followed, in the source file, by a stray duplicate of part of
practice 34's body (a paragraph beginning "es a source's vocabulary within
a single session..." — the tail end of a sentence that belongs, whole, to
practice 34, pasted a second time immediately after practice 39's own
`Install.` paragraph, with no heading of its own). This reads as a bad
merge or copy-paste in BestPractice's own history, not authored content.
[`tools/split_practices.py`](../tools/split_practices.py) drops it explicitly and by name
(`FIXUP_39_MARKER`), and [`tools/verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py)'s byte-identical-
regeneration check treats exactly that removal — plus two whitespace-only
quirks, a stray blank line between practices 40 and 41 and the file's one
`**Install.**` label followed by a newline instead of a space — as the
three sole approved exceptions to an otherwise-exact diff against the
original.

**Where the first pass got this wrong, since it is the instructive part.**
The stray fragment is pasted *mid-paragraph*: it begins mid-word on the
line immediately after practice 39's own `**Install.**` paragraph ends,
with no blank line between them. The converter's first version dropped
from the preceding *blank* line instead, which deleted practice 39's whole
Install paragraph — its template path, its wiring, the propagation
instructions — along with the corruption. **Every check in the harness
passed.** The no-invented-content check is a subset test, so a deletion
satisfies it trivially; and the byte-identical exception had been
hand-written to the same wrong boundary, so it agreed with the converter
instead of catching it. Two checks were added in response: a `no lost
content` mirror (making the word-multiset comparison an equality rather
than a subset), and `corruption drop is a verbatim duplicate`, which
asserts that whatever the converter drops occurs verbatim elsewhere in the
file. The second is the one that actually catches it, because it tests a
property of the dropped *text* rather than re-deriving the boundary — a
check that recomputes the boundary cannot catch a converter that got the
boundary wrong. Worth reporting upstream at the next real check-in (phase 7 territory,
or sooner if Alex wants to hear about it before then); not fixed upstream
by this session, which only has read access to `alex137/bestpractice`.

## Tooling

- `tools/split_practices.py split` — [`PRACTICES.md`](../PRACTICES.md) → `practices/*.md`.
- `tools/split_practices.py build [--diff]` — the reverse, for the
  byte-identical-regeneration check.
- [`tools/verify_harness.py`](../tools/verify_harness.py) — runs every check from the plan's verification
  harness that is meaningful given what exists; the rest report as
  not-yet-applicable, not as passed.
- `tools/precedent_show.py SLUG... [--why|--story|--install]` — the one
  code path an agent (or a human) uses to load a practice; never read
  `practices/*.md` directly.
