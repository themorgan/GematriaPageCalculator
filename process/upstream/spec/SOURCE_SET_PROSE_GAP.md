# Getting universal practice text into a practice-source set

**A session rooted in a practice-source set reads that set's own catalogue
and nothing else.** Universal rules do not bind it, because it never sees
them. The open item is
[TODO.md's `universal-prose-does-not-reach-a-source-set`](../todo/todo-2026-09-13-universal-prose-does-not-reach-a-source-set.md);
this brief costs the ways out of it. **Morgan approved the costing on
2026-09-13** (`assented` — he approved this session's recommendation to cost
both shapes rather than picking one blind). **Nothing here is decided.**

## What is actually missing, measured 2026-09-13

Each set's generated occasion index carries **only its own practices**:

| Set | Active practices | Occasion entries | `AGENTS.md` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `precedent-individual` | 17 | 14 | 9,283 B |
| `precedent-team-repo-maintenance` | 16 | 16 | 12,000 B |
| `precedent-team-writing` | 17 | 17 | 5,264 B |
| `precedent-team-working-style` | 5 | 3 | 5,551 B |
| universal (this repo) | 105 | 94 | 105,768 B |

None of the four carries a single one of universal's 94 occasion entries.
The incident that produced this brief is in
[practices/seeded-prompt-names-its-origin.md](../practices/seeded-prompt-names-its-origin.md)'s
`## Story`: a session in the individual set spawned one here and could not
have read `seeded-prompt-names-its-origin`, `spawn-session` or
`handoff-is-pasteable`, none of which were in front of it.

**What has to arrive, whichever shape wins:** universal's resident block
(**898 tokens**) plus its occasion index (**3,114 tokens**) — **4,011 tokens**
per session. For comparison, the equivalent file in the other direction,
`.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md`, has a declared ceiling of 4,000 tokens and
measures 2,887 here.

## Shape 1 — vendor the practice FILES into every set

Copy `practices/*.md` into each set and let its own `build_views.py` render
them.

- **Cost, counted:** 105 active files, **682,174 bytes**, into 4 sets —
  **420 tracked copies, ≈2.7 MB** of duplicated rule text living in four
  private git histories.
- **Drift is the real bill, and it is already being paid.** This session's own
  start reported **all four sets stale** against `origin/precedent-beta-v01`.
  Every edit to a universal practice would need a refresh-and-commit in four
  repositories on top of the one it landed in.
- **Already rejected once**, when `binds_publishers` was chosen over it, on
  exactly this ground: a second copy of rule text in every set.

**Verdict: no.** It buys the same 4,011 tokens the other shapes buy and adds
a duplication surface the project already decided against.

## Shape 2 — render universal into each set's committed loader block

Give each set a `precedent.json` naming universal as a source, and teach
`build_views.py` to render a resolved multi-source block into the set's
tracked `AGENTS.md`.

- **Cheaper than shape 1 on disk** — no practice files copied, only the
  rendered block.
- **Still commits the text**, so it still drifts: the block in four
  repositories has to be regenerated whenever universal moves, and a stale
  block is indistinguishable from a current one by reading it.
- **`build_views.py` renders one catalogue today.** The multi-source render
  is the change, and it is the same change the consumer side deliberately did
  **not** make — see
  [tools/precedent_session_practices.py](../tools/precedent_session_practices.py)'s
  header, "WHY THE COMMITTED VIEWS CANNOT SIMPLY BE MADE MULTI-SOURCE".

**Verdict: no.** It takes the drift of shape 1 and the code change of shape 3,
and buys nothing either of them does not.

## Shape 3 — the consumer mechanism, inverted (recommended)

Generate the universal block into an **untracked** `.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md`
inside each set at session start. This is
[tools/precedent_session_practices.py](../tools/precedent_session_practices.py)
run in the other direction: it already writes the levels a repo's *tracked*
block leaves out, and in a source set the level left out is universal.

**What it needs, counted:**

1. **Two engine files added to `ENGINE_FILES` (source kind) in
   [tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py):**
   `precedent_resolve.py` (1,004 lines) and `precedent_session_practices.py`
   (213 lines). **Both already exist and are proven in the consumer
   direction.** Their imports — `split_practices`, `build_views`,
   `precedent_identity` — are **already in the source list**, so nothing else
   travels.
2. **One code change, and it is small.** `precedent_session_practices.py`
   hardcodes `build_views.PRIVATE_LEVELS = ('team', 'individual')` as what to
   carry. That generalizes to *whatever levels the tracked block did not
   render*, which `build_views.py` already computes at
   [build_views.py:949-950](../tools/build_views.py).
3. **A `sources` entry in each set's `precedent.json`** naming universal.
4. **One `SessionStart` hook line per set**, alongside the two each already
   wires.

**Two things it does not need**, and both were checked rather than assumed:

- **No credential.** BestPractice is public, so a source set can clone it with
  nothing attached — recorded in
  [AGENTS.md's gotchas](../AGENTS.md#build-environment-gotchas--search-before-you-rediscover-one).
- **No leak exposure.** The direction that worried the consumer case was
  private text reaching a public commit. Here public text reaches a private,
  untracked file. The `.precedent/` path is already gitignored by the same
  convention.

**The one real wrinkle, found by measurement.** A relative `"path":
"../BestPractice"` does not resolve from every set: the individual source sits
at `$HOME/precedent-individual` — `/root` on this container — while the team
sets and this repository sit under `/home/user`. `precedent_resolve.py`
expands `~` for the *individual* entry (line 428) but a `sources` entry's path
is resolved relative to the repo. **Either the sources loader learns
`expanduser`/`expandvars`, or each set declares the universal path with `~`
and the loader is taught to expand it.** This is the same class as
`PRECEDENT_FRESHNESS_ALSO`'s "write the path as `~/name`, never spelled out",
and the same fix.

## Recommendation, and what was built

**Shape 3**, approved by Morgan on 2026-09-13 (`decided` — he chose it from
the three laid out here) and built the same day. It reuses machinery that is
already written and already load-bearing in the other direction; it commits no
copy of anything, so there is nothing to drift.

**What the build actually took, against what this brief predicted.** Two of
the four predictions held; two were wrong, and both in the same direction —
the brief looked at levels where the real rule is about trees.

| Predicted | What it took |
|---|---|
| Two engine files join `ENGINE_FILES` | Held. `precedent_resolve.py` and `precedent_session_practices.py`, both removed from the consumer-only list rather than duplicated — the vendor tool's own duplicate guard caught the first attempt. |
| One hardcoded `PRIVATE_LEVELS` generalizes | **Wrong shape.** The line is now drawn once, in `build_views.sources_for_tracked_block()`, and it is not a level filter at all: a practice set defers any source whose text lives in *another tree*, whatever its level. A level filter cannot express that, because the deferred level in a set is `universal`. |
| A `sources` entry per set | Held, and it needed a path expansion (`~`, `$HOME`) that the brief did name. |
| One hook line per set | Held. |
| — | **Missed entirely: nothing put universal's tree on disk beside a set.** `~/BestPractice` is wrong wherever `$HOME` and the sibling clones diverge, which is this container. `precedent_source_bootstrap.py`'s team-cloning loop now covers `universal` too, taking the URL and the pinned branch from `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`'s own `source_repo`/`source_branch` — no credential, since this repo is public, and nothing new declared. |
| — | **Missed entirely: nothing told the session to READ the file.** The standing instruction's pointer at `.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md` was conditional on `repo_is_public()` — one of the two reasons a source gets deferred — so it was suppressed in all four sets, which are private. The file was written correctly and never mentioned. Found 2026-09-14; the condition is now "did `sources_for_tracked_block()` defer anything", asked of the split itself. |
| — | **Missed entirely: `.precedent/` is not gitignored in a set.** Measured against a real set: `git check-ignore` said not ignored, so the generated file was offered to the next `git add -A` — which would commit universal's text into the set, the one thing shape 3 exists to prevent. Written by `precedent_bootstrap_source.py` for new sets and repaired by `precedent_refresh_sources.py --apply` for existing ones. |

**Measured working end to end, 2026-09-13**, against the real
`precedent-individual` set: universal cloned beside it on the pinned branch,
**106 practices and 92 occasion entries** written to its untracked
`.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md`, and `seeded-prompt-names-its-origin`,
`spawn-session`, `handoff-is-pasteable` and `go-update` all present — the four
that were absent when the session that produced this brief spawned one
without an origin header. Its committed `AGENTS.md` did not grow: with the
resolver importable, `sources_for_tracked_block` returned the set's own
source as tracked and universal as deferred, which is the difference between
shape 3 and shape 2. The test mutations were reverted; the rollout is its
own step.

**One thing this brief measured and could not see, 2026-09-14.** The
end-to-end test above checked that the file was written and what was in it.
Nobody checked whether a session is *told* to read it — and it was not, for a
day, in all four sets. Morgan found it from the outside, as the symptom:
sessions open on a practice repo and *"most of the rules I want aren't
loaded"*. **A generated artifact being correct is not the same as a session
loading it**, and only the second one is the point
([verify-postcondition](../practices/verify-postcondition.md) — the
postcondition here was never "the file exists").

**What shape 3 does NOT do**, and it is now an open item rather than a
footnote: a set reads the universal rules and still runs none of universal's
mechanical checks —
[TODO.md's `source-set-runs-no-universal-checks`](../todo/todo-2026-09-13-source-set-runs-no-universal-checks.md).
