# Migrating a repo that already has BestPractice installed

[INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) describes installing BestPractice fresh, and
[spec/SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) / [spec/PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md](PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md)
describe Precedent's three-source model and how the two private sets got
populated. Neither one is written for the repo in between: one that
already vendored BestPractice the old way (`process/upstream/` tracking
`main`, plus a second vendored tree for a personal/domain pack) and now
wants to adopt the three-source model on top of that existing install,
rather than starting from a blank page. This document is that missing
piece — **the recommended pattern**, not a plan, written from having
actually done it once, on a real repo, for the first time.

**[Essentials only](../INSTALL.md#essentials-only--what-an-install-upgrade-or-migration-leaves-for-later)
governs a migration too.** Bring the repo onto the three-source model,
correctly, and stop. A refinement the migration surfaces —
`local/practices/project-voice.md` and
`local/practices/project-visual-identity.md` being the standing
pair — gets one sentence saying it exists and can be done any time by asking
an assistant, never a walkthrough inside the migration. (Converting an
existing root `VOICE.md` or `STYLEGUIDE.md` into one of these is not that
kind of refinement — it is a mechanical rename the migration does itself,
step 3a below, because leaving both old and new in place is a worse state
than either alone.)

**Worked example: the project's own prior notes repository.** Everything below generalizes
what that repo's own migration actually did on 2026-09-02, first tested
against the real `precedent-shared-repo-maintenance` and `precedent-individual`
repos rather than fixtures. Its own record —
`process/PRECEDENT_MIGRATION.md`
(dependent repo, private; not fetchable from a BestPractice-only session) —
covers repo-specific detail this document deliberately leaves out; treat
this document as the pattern, that one as the instance. Its `TODO.md`
"Decisions" section carries the same change as a one-paragraph log entry,
per that repo's own conventions.

## When this applies

**Every repo whose `process/manifest.json` records an `upstream.repo`
pointing at BestPractice and that does not yet run the loader** — the
resident block, the occasion index, `precedent_check.py`'s enforced channel —
which [INSTALL.md §1](../INSTALL.md#1-install-into-a-dependent-repo) never
installed. **Not "wants": every such repo migrates** (2026-09-23). A classic
install is a repo with every practice on disk and none in force, and the
first one made after §1 was said to be retired still went down it — so §1
was retired as an install path outright, and
[tools/practice_audit.py](../tools/practice_audit.py)'s check 5 now fails
any repo still in that state. **An upstream update to a classic install is
where this usually starts**: step 1 below *is* that update, and the audit
that gates it will not pass until step 8 does, so the update and the
migration land as one change.

Steps 2, 5 and 6 apply only where there is **also** a second vendored tree
for domain/team/personal rules that did not come from BestPractice itself (a
"personal pack," a compliance pack, anything installed under
[layered-practice-packs](../PRACTICES.md#23-layered-practice-packs-a-domain-layer-between-generic-and-repo-local)'s
old pack mechanism). A repo with no such tree skips those three and does the
rest. A pack whose *source* repo has no plans to split into
Precedent-shaped shared/individual sets can stay a pack — the mechanism,
described in that practice's own Install section, is still supported — and
the repo still migrates the rest of the way onto the loader.

**Which copy of a tool each step runs.** Steps 1–6 run the copies already
vendored under `process/upstream/tools/`; the consuming repo's own `tools/`
is empty until step 7 seeds it, and from step 7 on every command below is
the consumer's own `tools/` copy. One exception in both halves:
`tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py` (steps 3 and 4) is **not** in the
consumer engine, so run it from a sibling Precedent clone
(`../BestPractice/tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py`), never from
`process/upstream/tools/` — the vendored copy records the *consuming* repo's
commit as the new set's engine provenance, which reads as an engine vendored
from a repository that has no engine. Measured 2026-09-14, on a rehearsal
that did exactly that.

## The pattern

**Step 0, before any of it: ask [every question INSTALL_QUESTIONS.md
lists](INSTALL_QUESTIONS.md) as asked at migration**, starting with which
practice sources this repo should declare. Not which it declares now —
which it *should*. Ask the person, in the conversation, and write each
answer where that table says it's stored — `precedent.json`'s declared
sources, `identity.json`'s `ci_workflows` field, and so on — as part of
the migration rather than leaving any of it for later. A migration is the
cheapest moment these questions will ever have: somebody is already
deciding what binds this repo.

**It has to be asked, not detected.** An undeclared source throws no error,
writes no file and leaves nothing missing — the repo simply resolves fewer
practices than its owner believes, and no check will ever say so, because
the sets a repo *could* declare are not derivable from the sets it *does*.
[practices/vendor-update-runbook.md](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md)
carries the same question as a numbered step, for every update after this
one.

**Asked means asked.** An environment variable, a freshness list, or a
standing bundle the person uses elsewhere can inform the question. It does
not answer it.

**A migration lands whole, or not at all.** Steps 3 through 8 go in one
change, and **one change means one pull request**, not one commit. Commit
as you go on the migration branch — step 5's decommission audit refuses a
path with uncommitted changes, so it needs commits to run against — and let
none of it reach the shared branch until step 8 passes. A `precedent.json`
merged alone is not progress: nothing reads it
until step 7 vendors the engine and step 8 materializes, and in the
meantime it has two effects, both bad. A repo that still carries its old
pack manifest starts failing `migration-scrubs-vocabulary`, which is
built to catch exactly that half-migrated state (step 5). And any
instructions-file line telling sessions to fetch the declared sources sends
every later session after sources that nothing uses. **If a step is blocked,
stop before opening the pull request** and say what blocked it. None of
these steps needs a permission rule the person adds by hand. A harness that
refuses one is answered by the person asking for the work directly, never by
widening what sessions may run
([the classifier gotcha](../gotchas/gotcha-2026-09-14-the-permission-classifier-refuses-commits-and-checks-in-the-.md)).

1. **Re-vendor `process/upstream/`.** If tracking a real, released
   BestPractice branch (the normal case once a Precedent-carrying branch
   has merged to `main`), this is an ordinary
   [INSTALL.md §2](../INSTALL.md#2-take-an-upstream-update) update:
   `checkin.py update` / `record`, three-way-merged per manifest entry. If
   — as the project's own prior notes repository deliberately did, to beta-test this exact pattern —
   the repo is pinning a **named non-default branch** ahead of its merge,
   read "The default-branch gotcha" below first: this step is a one-off
   manual mirror instead. (This used to add "and the scheduled sync workflow
   stays paused for the duration". Since 2026-09-14 there is no schedule to
   pause: step 6 below and "The default-branch gotcha" both say what
   replaced it.) `checkin.py`'s `fresh`, `status` and `record` *can* track a
   named branch as of 2026-09-06 — they read `upstream.branch` from the
   manifest now — and `update` refuses outright while that field names a
   branch other than the clone's default (the hold, below). **Add
   `upstream.branch` before running anything here**: without it `update`
   mirrors whatever the clone's default branch is, silently.

   **Then run the update once more, with the copy it just mirrored.** A
   classic install's vendored [checkin.py](../tools/checkin.py) is old enough not to know what
   later versions exclude from vendoring, so the first `update` can bring in
   hundreds of files the current tree never ships (about 950 in one real
   rehearsal, 2026-09-28). Run
   `python3 process/upstream/tools/checkin.py update ../BestPractice` a
   second time: the freshly mirrored copy names the excluded content an
   older copy brought in. Remove it with
   `rm -rf <the paths it names> && git add -A process/upstream` — the
   `git rm -r` it prints fails on paths that were never committed, which is
   what a first update leaves.

2. **Confirm the second tree's source has actually split**, and where each
   half landed, before touching anything local. Read that source's own
   README(s) for the allocation: which practices are genuinely
   person-specific (an individual set: commit identity, a timezone, a
   naming convention, a shorthand — see
   [spec/PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md](PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md)'s own "person-specific
   handful" inventory for the shape) versus everything else, which defaults
   to team ("narrowest first" — promoting team to universal is a designed
   path; demoting a universal practice back down is not).

3. **Add `precedent.json`** at the repo root, declaring:
   - `"visibility"` (`"public"` or `"private"`) and `"base_branch"`, both
     read from the repo rather than assumed. Omitting `visibility` counts as
     public, and a private repo that omits it silently loses its team and
     individual practices from the materialized tree
     ([INSTALL.md §0 step 2](../INSTALL.md#0-installing-directly-onto-the-precedent-loader)
     has both keys).
   - `level: "universal"` pointing at `process/upstream` — **stays a real
     vendored copy**, not a live path reference, even though Precedent's
     own self-hosted `precedent.json` uses `path: "."`. A dependent repo
     needs the vendored tree for offline work, for a collaborator or CI
     runner without a sibling BestPractice checkout, and for
     `process/manifest.json`'s own per-file drift tracking — none of which
     a live reference provides. Vendoring stays; only the *second* source
     moves off it.
   - `level: "shared"` pointing at a relative path to a sibling clone of the
     shared-set repo (`../<shared-set-repo-name>`) — **not** vendored. A shared set that
     already has its own maintained repo (unlike a domain pack with no repo
     yet) is resolved live, the same way Precedent's own `precedent.json`
     resolves `precedent-shared-repo-maintenance` for itself. On a hosted agent
     platform, resolving it live needs the session to actually have git
     read access to that sibling repo — step 4 below covers this gap and
     its fix together with the individual source's identical one; don't
     stop at declaring the path here and assume access follows.

     **If no shared-set repo exists yet, create one here rather than defaulting
     everything to repo-local.** `tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py
     --level shared` builds it from the skeleton
     ([BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md](BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md)). Before anybody
     picks a name, say out loud that the set's name is chosen once and
     written into every consumer's manifest
     ([source-naming](../practices/source-naming.md)), because a source
     repository that has to be renamed later redirects silently and git
     never notices. **A repo may declare as many team
     sets as it needs** (one individual set per person, however many teams
     they are on — [spec/SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md)), so a rule shared with
     one group and a rule shared with another do not have to be flattened
     into a single set.
   - **The shared sets for the repo's kind of work, not only its team's.**
     Declare what
     [INSTALL.md's "Which shared sets does this repo declare?" table](../INSTALL.md#1-install-into-a-dependent-repo)
     gives for this kind of repo — ordinarily that team's set plus
     `precedent-shared-writing` and `precedent-shared-working-style`, each
     a `level: "shared"` entry pointing at its sibling clone. Then **read
     the sync's output in step 8, not just its exit code**: every
     `IN FORCE NOWHERE` line is a rule this migration just lost. A
     by-the-book migration that declared only the team's set lost six that
     way, with every check green (2026-09-28).
   - **Never** a `level: "individual"` entry — `tools/precedent_resolve.py`
     refuses this by name, with the privacy reason in the message, and for
     good reason: naming a person's individual set in a repo anyone else on
     the team can read leaks that set's existence and location to them.
   - `level: "repo-local"`, if the old pack tree (or the old instructions
     file directly) carried rules true only of *this* repo's own subject
     matter, per [layered-practice-packs](../PRACTICES.md#23-layered-practice-packs-a-domain-layer-between-generic-and-repo-local)'s
     own decision rule ("only here?"). `path: "local"` — a subdirectory,
     holding `local/practices/*.md` — **is now the only path
     `tools/precedent_resolve.py` accepts for this level**, not merely the
     recommended one: the bare repo root (`path: "."`) is refused
     outright, because the root's own `practices/` is where
     `tools/precedent_sync_views.py` writes its resolved output, and a
     repo-local source declared there collides with that (see this
     document's own "Known gap" section below for what that collision
     actually does, reproduced, not theoretical). Every dependent repo
     ends up with the *same* name for its own local practices, `local/`,
     rather than each one picking its own.

3a. **Convert a root `VOICE.md` into `local/practices/project-voice.md`,
   if this repo has one — every migrating repo, not only one with a
   pre-existing pack tree.** Since 2026-09-17 this project's own voice is
   a repo-local practice, not a plain document
   (`templates/local-practices/project-voice.md.template`'s own header has
   the reasoning), so a repo installed before that date still has the old
   shape. Declare the `level: "repo-local"` source above if step 3 has not
   already, for this reason alone if for no other. Then:
   1. Read the existing `VOICE.md` once. Carry the decisions actually
      made — a filled-in Voice Target, a real Overrides entry, a genuine
      Words table row — not what merely shipped with the template
      (`<undecided>` placeholders carry nothing).
   2. Write those decisions into
      `templates/local-practices/project-voice.md.template`'s section
      structure at `local/practices/project-voice.md`, filling in `added`
      with this migration's date and `approved_by` with whoever is doing
      the migration.
   3. Delete `VOICE.md`. **In the same commit** — a repo carrying both is a
      repo where no session can tell which one is meant to bind.
   4. Update anything that still links to `VOICE.md` by name (an
      instructions-file bullet, a
      `local/practices/project-visual-identity.md` "Tone in Visuals"
      pointer) to point at `local/practices/project-voice.md` instead
      ([rename-updates-links](../practices/rename-updates-links.md)).
   5. Repoint the voice entry in `process/manifest.json`: `local_path`
      to the new practice file above, `upstream_path` to
      [templates/local-practices/project-voice.md.template](../templates/local-practices/project-voice.md.template). Then re-record
      its hash with
      `python3 process/upstream/tools/practice_audit.py --update-baseline`.
      Left alone, the entry names a file that no longer exists and the
      audit fails (`INTEGRITY: [upstream:voice] local_path missing`).

3b. **Convert a root `STYLEGUIDE.md` into
   `local/practices/project-visual-identity.md`, if this repo has one —
   every migrating repo, not only one with a pre-existing pack tree.**
   Since 2026-09-22 a project's own visual identity is a repo-local
   practice too, not a plain document
   (`templates/local-practices/project-visual-identity.md.template`'s own
   header has the reasoning), so a repo installed before that date still
   has the old shape. Declare the `level: "repo-local"` source above if
   step 3 has not already, for this reason alone if for no other. Then:
   1. Read the existing `STYLEGUIDE.md` once. Carry the decisions actually
      made — a filled-in color table, a real logo path, a genuine
      typography choice — not what merely shipped with the template
      (`<undecided>` placeholders and `<hex>` carry nothing).
   2. Write those decisions into
      `templates/local-practices/project-visual-identity.md.template`'s
      section structure at `local/practices/project-visual-identity.md`,
      filling in `added` with this migration's date and `approved_by` with
      whoever is doing the migration.
   3. Delete `STYLEGUIDE.md`. **In the same commit** — a repo carrying both
      is a repo where no session can tell which one is meant to bind.
   4. Update anything that still links to `STYLEGUIDE.md` by name (an
      instructions-file bullet, a deck-engine pointer) to point at
      `local/practices/project-visual-identity.md` instead
      ([rename-updates-links](../practices/rename-updates-links.md)).
   5. Repoint the visual-identity entry in `process/manifest.json` the
      same way: `local_path` to the new practice file above,
      `upstream_path` to
      [templates/local-practices/project-visual-identity.md.template](../templates/local-practices/project-visual-identity.md.template), then
      `python3 process/upstream/tools/practice_audit.py --update-baseline`.

4. **Wire the person, not only the repo — an individual source, a
   declared identity, and a commit author that is a human being.** A
   migrating repo differs from a fresh one in the way that matters here:
   **people have already been committing to it**, so the identity machinery
   arrives after the history it grades rather than before it. Do all four
   parts; none of them is implied by the others.

   **4a. Does the person have an individual set at all?** A migration is
   the first moment anyone asks. If they do not, create one now —
   [BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md](BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md) is the procedure,
   `tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py --level individual` the tool (from
   a sibling Precedent clone, per "Which copy of a tool each step runs"
   above). **Before step 8, replace the placeholder practice in every set
   created here** — `practices/example-starter-<level>.md` — with one real
   practice, or delete it: the sync refuses a declared source that
   contributes nothing. If
   they decline, say plainly what that costs: their personal practices are
   silently absent from every session, and the identity below has to come
   from the environment instead.

   **4b. Fill in `identity.json`.** The set ships it with placeholders — `name`, `email`, `pronouns`,
   `timezone` — and `precedent_bootstrap_source.py --verify <the set's
   path>` names each one still unfilled and exits non-zero. **The
   timezone is the half people skip**, and skipping it does not fail
   loudly — the hook only *enforces* an author-date offset somebody
   declared, so an unfilled zone silently downgrades the check to a guess
   and wrong-offset commits reach the remote before anyone notices. Use an
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) zone name
   (`America/New_York`), never a bare offset.

   **4c. Let `commit-identity.sh` be wired, and don't decline it.** Step
   7's `precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh` wires it along with every other
   hook a consumer gets; nothing here needs a hand edit. [INSTALL.md
   §1](../INSTALL.md#1-install-into-a-dependent-repo)'s hook table says
   **always** and explains why the install that declined it was wrong to.
   It names no person: it resolves whoever is running the session and then
   refuses commits authored by the assistant's bot account. After step 7,
   verify by effect rather than by reading the config the refresh
   wrote —
   `env -u GIT_AUTHOR_NAME -u GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL -u TZ git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT`
   must name a person and the declared offset.

   **4d. Then look at the history that predates all of this, once.** If the
   person's individual set carries a commit-author check, it scans commits
   already in the repo, and a migrating repo may well hold some authored by
   a bot or under a wrong offset. **An unpushed commit gets fixed, not
   listed.** For commits already published, rewriting history costs more
   than the wrong value does
   ([no-rewrite-for-warnings](../practices/no-rewrite-for-warnings.md)),
   so exempt them: each one an entry in the migrating repo's
   `precedent.json` `grandfathered_commit_shas` (an individual or shared
   source uses its own `identity.json`; a consumer must not carry one), with a `sha` and a **note saying why**. Do
   this deliberately at migration time and the list stays short and
   explicable; leave it and every later session meets a check that has
   never once been green, which is the state people learn to ignore.

   Then, the harness wiring the rest of this step is about:

   **Wire the individual source's own bootstrap, if the person has one and
   the harness needs it.** For a Claude Code Web session specifically, this
   is [`templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/individual-source-bootstrap.sh.template`](../templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/individual-source-bootstrap.sh.template) —
   instantiate it with
   `python3 ../BestPractice/tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py --level
   individual --name <the set's name> --write-session-hook <target repo
   path> [--repo-url <the set's git URL>; omit in a public repo]` -- the
   hook-only form, which creates and touches no set (with `--dest` it is
   create mode, and refuses a set that already exists)
   (see [BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md](BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md)), which writes
   the target repo's tracked `.claude/hooks/precedent-individual-bootstrap.sh`
   for you. Then wire it yourself — the tool writes the hook and nothing
   else: add a `SessionStart` entry running
   `bash $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/precedent-individual-bootstrap.sh`
   to the target's own `.claude/settings.json`, **first in the array, ahead
   of `commit-identity.sh`** (which reads the set it clones), appending to
   an existing `SessionStart` array rather than replacing it. (Until
   2026-09-14 this step named a `bootstrap/settings.snippet.json` to merge;
   no such file has ever been written.) This makes the individual
   source resolvable without ever naming it in the repo's own tracked
   config — but on its own it is **not** zero manual steps on a hosted
   agent platform, which is the next part of this step, not a separate
   concern.

   *(Before 2026-09-05 this step said to hand-copy the individual repo's
   own `claude-web-bootstrap`-practice script. Don't — that per-adopter
   hand copy is exactly what let the gap below go unnoticed in more than
   one place at once; see the incident this rewrite is based on below.)*

   **The session-repo-access gate.** On Claude Code Remote/Web, a
   session's git access is scoped *per session* — attached when it's
   created, or added mid-session — never inherited just because a
   project's config or a hook references another repo by name. A
   brand-new session opened on only the consuming project has no git
   credentials for either sibling repo at all, so the individual
   bootstrap hook above, and the shared source's live resolution in step 3,
   both fail on a fresh session with nothing wrong in the code — until
   this gate is closed.

   **This costs no token or secret.** The tool that extends a session's
   scope to another repo (`add_repo` in Claude Code Remote/Web) rides the
   *same* GitHub identity already behind that session; it only ever
   succeeds because the person is already a collaborator on the target
   repo — the same fact that let them declare the source at all. There is
   nothing to generate, store, or rotate. The consuming repo's own
   `AGENTS.md` still needs the plain instruction this always required:
   **call `add_repo` (read access) for both the shared and individual
   sibling repos at the very start of every session, before running any
   bootstrap script, without asking first** — reaching for both is the
   session's own job every time, since repo access is a per-session grant
   that does not persist to the next one, and `add_repo` granting only
   read access is exactly why it doesn't need to wait for a human's yes
   first.

   **That instruction is necessary and, on its own, not sufficient — two
   independent adopters proved it, 2026-09-05.** This step used to claim
   the `add_repo` instruction above was "the one behavioral fix that
   closes [the gate] for both sources at once." It is not: a
   `SessionStart` hook runs *entirely to completion* before the agent's
   own first turn starts — a strict ordering, not a race with variable
   odds (Claude Code's own docs for this hook: synchronous mode
   "guarantees dependencies are installed before your session starts") —
   so an instruction telling the agent to call `add_repo` "before running
   any bootstrap script" cannot make that tool call precede a hook the
   harness has already started running, at any retry count or delay. Both
   a private consumer repo and (by report) a second, independent repo hit
   exactly this: the individual source silently wasn't resolving because
   its bootstrap hook had already run and failed before `add_repo`
   completed, and nothing said so — it read as "no individual set," not
   "not yet."

   **The real fix ships in the engine, and — corrected 2026-09-06 — only
   one of its two originally-claimed halves actually does anything.**
   [`tools/precedent_resolve.py`](../tools/precedent_resolve.py)'s own
   `load_config()` treats "the individual config is absent, and this is a
   remote session" as "try the bootstrap hook once more" rather than "no
   individual set" — and because that re-invocation runs from inside the
   agent's own turn, always after `add_repo`, it succeeds where the
   original hook invocation structurally could not. This is the entire
   fix. A first version of this paragraph also credited
   [`tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py`](../tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py)
   retrying the clone "instead of trying once (the hook usually wins the
   race on its own now)" — a follow-up testing session proved that false
   by direct test: every retry the hook itself makes runs before the
   agent's turn, and therefore `add_repo`, can start, on a genuinely fresh
   session, without exception. It is not a partial mitigation; it is
   inert for this specific gap, and previously cost every cold session
   real, wasted latency. Corrected the same day: that tool now defaults
   to a single attempt (retrying stays available, opt-in, for an
   unrelated genuine transient-network case — never claimed as a fix for
   this one). See
   [`practices/session-bootstrap.md`](../practices/session-bootstrap.md)'s
   Story for the incident, and this correction, in full. The `add_repo`
   instruction above stays required — the self-heal has nothing to
   retry *into* without it — it is just closed by a hook running again
   *after* that instruction has taken effect, never by one trying harder
   *before* it has.

   **And when `add_repo` cannot work at all, close the gate with a
   credential instead — the durable route, added 2026-09-09.** Everything
   above assumes `add_repo` eventually succeeds. It does not when the
   practice sets and the consuming repo belong to **different GitHub
   owners**: the call is refused outright (*"cross-tier adds are not
   supported in v1"*), reproduced that day as a session's very first tool
   call, so no ordering fixes it and the self-heal has nothing to retry
   into. Set `PRECEDENT_GIT_TOKEN` and `PRECEDENT_SOURCE_BASE_URL` in the
   environment's own configuration
   ([PER_MACHINE_SETUP.md](../documentation/PER_MACHINE_SETUP.md)):
   a credential the environment carries is available to the SessionStart
   hook itself, before the agent's first turn, which is the one thing
   `add_repo` can never be. Then
   `python3 tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py --teams-from .` clones every
   shared set the repo declares, and the individual set's own hook succeeds on
   its first attempt. **Verify rather than assume it took:**
   `python3 tools/precedent_source_credentials.py` prints `MISSING` for
   exactly the state this closes, and the same line appears in the session
   check and at every vendor update. Whether the sets resolve at all is not
   a thing to infer from the absence of an error — until 2026-09-09 there
   was no error, only silence and the universal catalogue.

5. **Retire the old vendored pack tree — always, not if convenient.** The
   pack's rules live in a shared or individual source now; the tree left
   behind is a second, unsynced copy of rules nobody reads and nothing
   updates. Two rules follow, and the second is the one repos actually miss:

   - **A repo migrating now deletes it as part of the migration.** This
     step, not a follow-up somebody has to request
     ([migration-scrubs-vocabulary](../practices/migration-scrubs-vocabulary.md)).
   - **A repo that ALREADY migrated and still has one deletes it now.**
     Confirmed with Morgan 2026-09-07, for `RepoPersonalPreferences`
     specifically: its 46 rules were migrated into the private
     individual and shared sets on 2026-09-01
     ([PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md](PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md)), and 44 of the
     landed practices across those three sets still cite it as their
     origin — so the content is safely elsewhere and the vendored copy is
     pure deadweight. **This is about the vendored copy inside each
     consuming repo, not the source repository itself**, which is a
     separate decision with its own owner.

   **Deleting the tree is the easy half; the citations are the hard half.**
   A repo that vendored a pack does not merely *contain* it — it cites the
   pack's rules by section number in its own instructions file
   (`process/<pack>/README.md §12`), and those citations are the rules being
   enforced. Delete the tree without repointing them and the repo is left
   instructing every session to follow a file that is not there. So, in
   order, and the first item is not optional:

   1. **Declare the sources first**, in the same change. A pack's rules
      move into *shared and individual* sources far more often than into the
      universal catalogue — measured on the one real case, sixteen of
      twenty-two — so a repo that deletes the tree before declaring its
      shared sources in `precedent.json` and wiring the individual one (step
      4; never a `precedent.json` entry) has nowhere left to get them. It does not
      fail loudly; it just stops carrying the rules.
   2. **Repoint every `§N` citation** at the practice that replaced it.
      Keep a **pack-retirement map** — one table, pack section to practice
      slug and source — in the *individual or shared source that owns the
      pack's successor rules*, not here: which rules a given pack became is
      a fact about one person's or one team's sources, and this document
      cannot know it. Write the map once and every later repo's migration
      reads it instead of re-deriving the answer. **A map's own procedure
      must not say to declare the individual set in `precedent.json`** —
      the first real map did, and the engine refuses that entry by design
      (step 3).
   3. **Then** salvage, repoint what reaches in, delete the sync workflow,
      and retire the tree through the audit below.

   In a repo that has finished migrating, most citations can simply go
   rather than be repointed: the loader carries the practice, so a prose
   restatement of it is a second copy
   ([registry-source-of-truth](../practices/registry-source-of-truth.md)).

   **Until then, leave the pack's manifest pointing where it points.** When
   a pack's source repository is renamed or restructured into a Precedent
   set, its freshness check starts failing every session. The fix is this
   step, not a new URL in the manifest. The restructured repository no longer
   holds the files the manifest tracks, so repointing it turns an honest
   "could not verify" into a "source has moved" notice that invites pulling
   a practice set into the pack's tree. The notice stops when the tree is
   retired.

   **Mentions survive only in files you list.** A provenance note, a
   decision record, a backlog entry naming the old pack is history worth
   keeping — but the check that enforces
   [migration-scrubs-vocabulary](../practices/migration-scrubs-vocabulary.md)
   reads whole files, not lines: a mention survives only in a file named in
   `exempt_files` below, and a provenance line in the instructions file or a
   practice's Story is flagged like any other (measured 2026-09-14). Put the
   history in the migration record and exempt that; reword the rest. What
   goes is the tree, the *use* of it, and the citations that depend on it;
   not the memory that it existed.

   `python3 process/upstream/tools/precedent_check.py --only
   migration-scrubs-vocabulary` now finds a leftover without being told to:
   it flags any `process/manifest_<pack>.json` in a repo that carries a
   `precedent.json`. It stays silent for a repo that has **not** migrated —
   the pack mechanism is still supported there, per "When this applies"
   above — and a pack whose upstream genuinely never split can record a
   `kept_after_migration` reason in its manifest and be left alone. Nine
   cases in [tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py), including
   both must-not-fire cases.

   Salvage anything in the tree that was never really *pack content* — a
   generic utility script the pack
   happened to carry (a light-check runner, an issue-reporter), not a rule.
   Relocate those to the consuming repo's own `tools/`, since they're
   repo-owned infrastructure now, not something with an upstream to sync
   against. Delete the pack's own manifest file, its README, its templates.
   Anything the pack's own tooling depended on (a merge-runbook file-class
   rule naming the old manifest, a CI workflow calling the old tool path)
   needs the same update.

   **Delete through the audit, not by hand**
   ([decommission-deletes-files](../practices/decommission-deletes-files.md)):
   `python3 process/upstream/tools/precedent_decommission.py process/<old-pack-tree> process/manifest_<pack>.json`
   (both — the pack's manifest references the tree, so the audit refuses
   until it goes too; the vendored copy, since `tools/` is not seeded until
   step 7) reports
   every tracked file that still references the tree — including the ones
   this step's own list does not name — and refuses while any remain, which
   is the same property `rename-updates-links` will otherwise fail on after
   the fact. Re-run it until it reports `CLEAR`, then
   `--reason "..." --apply` deletes the tree and records the retirement in
   `process/decommissioned_paths.json`, so a later mirror or materialization
   putting it back is caught rather than absorbed.

   **Scrub the old system's whole vocabulary now, in this same migration —
   never as a separate cleanup someone has to ask for later**
   ([migration-scrubs-vocabulary](../practices/migration-scrubs-vocabulary.md)).
   This is broader than the file paths above: the old system's real name,
   any secret or token name it used, and every paragraph that explains
   what a now-retired workflow *used to do* — grep the whole repo, not
   just the obvious files (this repo's own conventions doc, glossary, map,
   onboarding page, and any comment inside a workflow configuration file
   (YAML) that used the old system as a running example) before
   considering this step done. Declare what
   you find once, don't decide file-by-file: write
   `process/retired_vocabulary.json` —
   ```json
   {
     "terms": ["<the old repo or system's real name>", "<a retired secret name>", "..."],
     "exempt_files": ["process/PRECEDENT_MIGRATION.md", "TODO.md", "<any file that is explicitly a historical log by its own stated purpose>"]
   }
   ```
   `process/PRECEDENT_MIGRATION.md` is **yours to write** — a short record
   of what this migration moved where, which pack section became which
   practice — and it is the one file where the old names may stay in full.
   — then run `python3 process/upstream/tools/precedent_check.py --only retired-words` (the terms) and `... --only migration-scrubs-vocabulary` (a leftover pack), and don't call this step done until both pass. The exempt list is deliberately short: the migration record itself, plus files whose *own stated purpose* is a historical log (a decision-record directory, a dated brainstorm journal) — never a file merely because it happens to still mention the old system. Leaving that config in place afterward means the check keeps watching: any *new* mention that creeps back in during a later edit fails the same way.

   **A `/`-suffixed `exempt_files` entry exempts a whole directory**, not
   just one file — reach for this only for a *materialized*, regenerated
   directory (this repo's own `practices/`, wherever
   `tools/precedent_materialize.py` fills it in from every declared
   source): that directory can legitimately hold another source's own
   content, unrelated to this migration, and its file list changes on
   every sync — hand-listing it file-by-file would go stale. Don't reach
   for a directory exemption anywhere else; a retired term in this repo's
   own hand-authored tree is real, unfinished migration work.

6. **Retire the old PACK's sync workflow entirely — the file is deleted,
   not disabled** (the workflow that vendored the second tree; the
   consuming repo's own `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml` is a different
   file, retired too — see below. There is nothing left to vendor-and-sync for the
   shared/individual sources — they resolve live). Keeping the sibling
   clones themselves fresh becomes a session-start concern (a best-effort
   `git pull --ff-only` for the shared-set clone; the individual clone's own
   bootstrap script does the same for itself), not a scheduled GitHub
   Actions job.

   **"Entirely" means the workflow file leaves the tree**, and this step
   used to leave that implicit — which read as complied-with by anyone who
   commented out a `schedule:` block, especially since the "default-branch
   gotcha" section below spells out *pausing* mechanics exactly. Pause
   first if the job is still live ([precedent_decommission.py](../tools/precedent_decommission.py) refuses to
   retire a workflow whose `on:` block carries any trigger but
   `workflow_dispatch`, so a retirement is never the first thing that
   stops a running job), let one cycle pass, then run the same audit-then-
   `--apply` sequence step 5 describes.

   **The consuming repo's own `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml` goes too**
   (2026-09-24, Morgan, strength: decided — *"this needs to be deleted from
   ALL installs, the migration to the new precedent should [have] deleted
   this"*). `Update Vendors` replaced it, and nothing runs it. You rarely
   have to do this by hand: from the first refresh after step 7 seeds the
   engine, `precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh` deletes it whenever its
   content has the old shape (manual trigger only, running
   `anthropics/claude-code-action` or [checkin.py](../tools/checkin.py)), tracked or not, and
   records the deletion. A copy it cannot recognise, or one still on a live
   trigger, is listed under **Left for you** at the end of the refresh, and
   [vendor-update-runbook](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md) step 10
   has the session finish it. The secrets only it read
   (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) are the person's to
   delete, if nothing else reads them; the same step files them as one todo.

   **What changed 2026-09-14:** this used to read "stays, paused
   deliberately", pointing at
   [TODO.md](../todo/todo-2026-09-06-relax-the-pinned-branch-hold.md)'s hold as a pause with
   a stated condition for lifting it. The condition no longer lifts
   anything. Morgan killed every scheduled vendor update — *"No weekly
   updates. I had that weeks ago, but we're not doing that anymore; this is
   now really complex and deserves hand attention and issues come up every
   time and I'm on it every day anyway."* **Strength:** decided
   ([decision-strength](../practices/decision-strength.md)). So the
   `schedule:` block is **deleted, not commented out**, and the workflow
   keeps only its manual trigger. The distinction the old wording drew — a
   hold versus a leftover — still mattered then for the *file*, which
   stayed; on 2026-09-24 the file went too (below).

   **What changed 2026-09-24:** until then this step said the file stays,
   on `workflow_dispatch` only, "so a person can still run it by hand". That
   reason outlived its premise. The file was kept first as a paused hold with
   a condition for lifting it, then, once the schedules were killed on
   2026-09-14, as a manual fallback. The 2026-09-24 audit of six installs
   found four different copies, the only reader of the Claude keys in each
   repo carrying one, and in the one repo whose run history it read, three
   runs and no success. "Update Vendors" had been doing its job all along.

   **The same pass also sweeps every OTHER pre-Precedent `.github/workflows/`
   file this repo carries** (2026-09-16, spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md items
   2/2a/3) — measured against a real account's usage report, workflows from
   before this repo's current template set accounted for 42% of one
   reporting period's total minutes, in repos that had never had a chance
   to opt out because the setting to opt out did not exist yet. **Per file,
   never a blanket delete:**

   | File | Verdict |
   |---|---|
   | `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml` | **Retired** (2026-09-24, above). The refresh deletes a copy with the old shape automatically; anything else it lists for the session. |
   | `bestpractice-docs.yml` | **Retired** (2026-09-21 — [tools/doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py) already gates every commit). The refresh deletes a copy that only runs that linter, hand-paused or not, tracked or not. |
   | `views-drift.yml` | **Retired** (2026-09-19). Its check runs in the local push check as `generated-artifact-provenance` in `tools/precedent_check.py`. Deleted by the refresh when paused and stock-shaped; a live copy is listed, to be paused first. |
   | `practice-links-travel.yml` | **Retired.** Its check runs in the local push check as `practice-links-travel`; since 2026-09-27 a consumer's CI converges to upstream, so the refresh removes this copy. |
   | `commit-identity.yml` (the ordinary dependent-repo copy, not the practice-set workflow this step already covers), `status-claims-check.yml`, `unified-prompt-check.yml`, `platform-docs-check.yml` | **No trace in this repo's own history** — none of them were ever a Precedent template, in this branch or any other this repo can see. Confirm in the repo carrying the file what each one actually checks before touching it; a check with no equivalent anywhere in the current engine is a gap to raise with the person, not a file to delete on a guess. The refresh lists each one it finds. |
   | `light-check.yml` | **Not a leftover.** It is a current template ([templates/github-actions/light-check.yml.template](../templates/github-actions/light-check.yml.template), added 2026-09-21) and a live check in most installs, sometimes running the repo's own `tools/light_check.py`. Nothing deletes it. Until 2026-09-24 this table listed it with the "never a Precedent template" row, which stopped being true the day the template landed. |

   Applying `ci_workflows`
   ([GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](../documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)) to whatever CI templates this
   migration keeps is part of the same pass, per
   [spec/INSTALL_QUESTIONS.md](INSTALL_QUESTIONS.md)'s row for it.
   `ci_debounce_minutes` is **retired** (2026-09-20) and is not applied to
   anything: the refresh deletes the field from `precedent.json` and
   `identity.json` (since 2026-09-24; before that, by hand). It
   bought nothing at any setting, because the job that read it cost the
   same billed minute it was deciding whether to spend
   ([spec/BILLING_FLOOR.md](BILLING_FLOOR.md)).

7. **Rewrite the consuming repo's own instructions file** (`AGENTS.md` or
   equivalent) from
   [templates/AGENTS.md.loader.template](../templates/AGENTS.md.loader.template)
   — the loader template, not the classic `AGENTS.md.template`, which has
   no markers — keeping the same `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: precedent-loader -->` /
   `<!-- END GENERATED -->` markers this repo's own `AGENTS.md` uses. Before
   running it, vendor the whole engine at the consuming repo's own `tools/`
   — not nested under `process/upstream/tools/`, which stays reserved for
   the audit/sync tools that operate on the vendored universal tree itself
   — with
   `python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py seed <consuming repo> --kind consumer`,
   run from a Precedent (BestPractice) clone, rather than copying files by
   hand. It writes a tracked `tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json` (the exact commit
   vendored, a sha256 per file) so a later Precedent update can be picked
   up with `status`/`refresh` instead of repeating this step from scratch —
   see [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md)'s "Keep the vendored engine current
   (consumer repos)" step under §2.

   **Then refresh it once, straight away:**
   `python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh ../BestPractice`, from
   the consuming repo. `seed` only copies the engine; the refresh is what
   wires the hooks into `.claude/settings.json` (step 4c's
   `commit-identity.sh` among them) and retires the old workflows step 6
   names. It cannot guess the base branch for `freshness-guard.sh`'s three
   entries, so it reports them rather than wiring them: add those by hand,
   with this repo's real base branch as the argument, per [INSTALL.md
   §1](../INSTALL.md#1-install-into-a-dependent-repo). Then run
   `python3 tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo .` to fill the markers in from the
   *real* resolved set — universal, team, individual and repo-local, all
   four. **Don't hand-curate a subset and call it a stopgap**: that was only
   ever necessary because nothing connected the resolver's output to a
   generated view; now something does, so there's nothing to approximate by
   hand. The temptation to inline the shared/individual catalogues the way the
   old pack was inlined in full still applies just as much as it always did
   — resist it; the generated block *is* the non-duplicated form.

   **`tools/precedent_check.py` no longer needs a separate hand-copy**
   (changed 2026-09-06). It used to: the vendoring tool covered the loader
   engine only, on the reasoning that `checked_by` enforcement is a
   different channel — so a migration that ran the vendor step and stopped
   ended up with a working loader and **no enforced-checks tool at all**.
   Confirmed real, not hypothetical: the project's own prior notes repository followed
   this step exactly as it was then written (2026-09-06) and ended up
   without `tools/precedent_check.py` for precisely that reason. It is in
   `CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES` now, along with the three audit tools several
   universal practices' checks call by name (`doc_lint.py`, `doc_sync.py`,
   `routing_audit.py`) and the individual-source bootstrap
   (`precedent_source_bootstrap.py`), each of which was silently absent for
   the same reason. Still verify with a real run — `python3
   tools/precedent_check.py --list`, then a plain invocation — before
   moving on: the vendoring manifest proves the bytes arrived, not that
   they run here.

   **7b. Then review every hand-written rule left in that file**, and in
   `CLAUDE.md`, against the practices now in force. This is the
   conflicted-file review every update runs
   ([vendor-update-runbook](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md)),
   applied to the whole file, because a migration is the first time the
   generated block and the hand-written rules sit side by side. Nothing is
   deleted for being hand-written: a rule that duplicates a practice in
   force goes, one that conflicts is kept only as a confirmed local
   exception, and one that covers what no practice covers stays.

   Two kinds get the same review with one extra step. A blanket precedence
   clause ("the personal pack wins on conflict") is kept only narrowed to
   rules that are both current, since the engine already ranks the sources.
   A decline written as prose ("declined X as a duplicate") is decided
   again against the current upstream file. If it stands, it is recorded as
   a `declined` manifest entry with `practice_audit.py --redecide`.

   Say in the pull request which rules were kept, which were deleted, and
   why. `practice_audit.py` warns on lines that read like the last two
   kinds (check 7). Incident, 2026-09-24: a consumer's hand-written clause let an old
   personal copy of the merge command outrank the current rule, and a
   session answered the command with a question
   ([current-rule-governs](../practices/current-rule-governs.md)).

8. **Validate for real**, not against a fixture. **What a clean migrated
   run needs, beyond the sync**: a plain `python3 tools/precedent_check.py`
   on a migrated repo is red for reasons no step above creates and none
   warns about (measured 2026-09-14: five violations on a by-the-book
   rehearsal). Each has a one-line declaration: instantiate `MAP.md` from
   its template (`orientation-map`); instantiate `tools/bootstrap.sh` from
   [templates/bootstrap.sh](../templates/bootstrap.sh), which invokes the
   access probe (`access-probe-is-wired`); either wire or decline each
   harness adapter the universal source installs into `.claude/hooks/` —
   `precedent-universal-catalogue.sh` is for practice sets and a consumer
   declines it in `precedent.json`'s `declined_adapters` with the reason
   (`hooks-on-disk-are-reachable`). **Declining it gives up one thing a
   consumer still needs**: it was, until 2026-09-26, the only session-start
   step that cloned the shared sources `precedent.json` declares. The
   template's `tools/bootstrap.sh` carries that step now ("Clone every
   shared practice set"). A consumer with an edited `tools/bootstrap.sh`
   must carry that block itself, or declare in `source_clone_elsewhere`
   what clones its sets instead (`declared-sources-are-cloned` fails it
   otherwise). Without the step, a declared set is missing from every
   fresh container and the loader block reads as drifted
   ([the gotcha](../gotchas/gotcha-2026-09-26-a-declared-shared-set-is-never-cloned-in-a-consumer-s-fresh.md)); create `process/scrub_blocklist.txt`
   if the manifest names one (`scrub-gate`); and, since 2026-09-19, run
   `python3 tools/todo_migrate.py --source todo.md --apply` then `python3
   tools/build_todo_index.py` if `TODO.md` is still the old single-file
   format — no `todo/` directory, no `# TODO has moved` stub heading — now
   that the migration is vendored into every migrated repo, not only
   consumers (`todo-migrate-available-but-unused`). Then: `python3
   tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo .` from the consuming repo, with
   its `precedent.json` and a real user-level individual config in place.
   Last, since 2026-09-25: `python3 tools/precedent_branches.py
   --ensure-tiers --apply`, so the migrated repo has `pre-staging` and a
   `staging` branch of its own on origin -- since 2026-09-27 Update
   Vendors makes them too, even on a repo it sends to this migration, so
   this is a check that they exist -- and commit the
   `"staging_branch": "staging"` it writes into `precedent.json` when the
   repo's staging tier had been `main`.
   Check the reported precedence, any `overridden`/`blocked` entries, the
   combined resident-block budget, and that the generated `AGENTS.md`
   actually names practices from every source that's supposed to be in
   play — this is the first place any of that runs against real content
   rather than the verification harness's synthetic sources. Re-run with
   `--check` on a second pass to confirm it's stable (byte-identical,
   nothing left to regenerate) before committing the result.

   **Every workflow file needs the person's approval before the migration
   is done** ([ci-workflow-approved](../practices/ci-workflow-approved.md),
   2026-09-25). Run `python3 tools/precedent_check.py --only
   ci-workflow-approved`. For each file it names, show the person what it
   runs and when it triggers, and ask. Record their words in
   `precedent.json`'s `github_ci_approved`, pinned by sha256, or delete the
   file. A legacy check the old install left, like a repo's own
   `light-check.yml`, is exactly what this is for: it keeps running on
   whatever triggers the last session gave it, and nothing upstream ever
   updates it.

   **Re-confirm step 5's vocabulary scrub here too, as a named gate, not
   just at the moment step 5 itself was done.** `process/retired_vocabulary.json`
   has no other check pointed at it and nothing else in this pattern
   revisits it — a migration that got interrupted between steps, or a
   session that skipped straight to validating the sync and never
   circled back, leaves the check permanently silent (`NotApplicable`
   forever looks identical to "correctly scrubbed," from outside) with no
   later step catching the gap. Run `python3 process/upstream/tools/precedent_check.py
   --only retired-words` and `--only migration-scrubs-vocabulary` here, as part of *this* validation
   pass, and do not consider the migration finished until it passes —
   the same requirement step 5 already states, restated at the one point
   in this pattern that claims the migration is actually validated.

9. **Backfill every `## Story` the conversion left empty, before calling the
   migration done.** This is the step most likely to be skipped, because
   nothing about the result looks broken: every Rule is present and
   enforceable, and only the reason each rule exists is missing.

   [split_practices.py](../tools/split_practices.py) does not populate
   `## Story`, deliberately and for a good reason it documents in its own
   docstring — separating an incident from its reasoning is editorial
   judgment, and doing it unreviewed across a whole catalogue in one pass
   risks mischaracterizing exactly the content the migration exists to
   preserve. It leaves the section present and empty as a **declared** gap.
   The failure is not the converter; it is that nobody comes back.

   So come back here, in the migrating session, while the source system is
   still open in front of you:

   ```
   python3 tools/precedent_check.py --only catalogue-carries-stories
   ```

   It names every `status: active` practice still carrying an empty Story
   ([catalogue-carries-stories](../practices/catalogue-carries-stories.md)),
   and it is a tree-scoped invariant rather than a changed-files gate
   precisely so that a bulk landing cannot pass it and a gap left behind
   cannot go quiet later.

   **The work is transcription, not authorship.** The incidents are in the
   system being migrated from — that is why nothing is lost by the
   conversion, only made unreachable. Write each Story from that original
   text. Working from the practice's own Rule instead produces
   plausible-sounding invented incidents, which are worse than the empty
   section they replace: an empty section is a visible gap, and a
   fabricated one is a false record that will be trusted. Where the source
   recorded reasoning rather than a failure, say so plainly — that is a
   complete Story, and roughly half of them are this kind.

   **Scrub while transcribing.** The source system's text names private
   repos, real people and internal specifics freely, because it lived
   somewhere that never shipped. A practice file ships.

   **The same step applies to an update of an earlier migration**, not only
   to a first run. A repo migrated before this step existed is carrying the
   gap right now, and the check is what tells you whether it is: run it
   against any already-migrated repo and it answers immediately. Do not
   assume a later engine refresh will fix it — an engine refresh carries
   tools, never practice text, so nothing about it can fill a Story.

## Upgrading a repo that already migrated before 2026-09-14

A repo whose migration predates Morgan's 2026-09-14 decision to kill every
scheduled vendor update ("The default-branch gotcha" above, and
[vendor-update-runbook](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md)) followed
step 6 as it read *then* — pause the pack's sync workflow, don't delete it.
Bringing such a repo forward now is not a fresh migration, so the steps
above won't surface what it's still carrying. Check these specifically,
each a real thing step 5/6 found on real repos rather than a hypothetical:

- **A pack-sync workflow file that is merely paused, not deleted** — a
  `schedule:` block commented out, or an `if: false` guard, instead of a
  `workflow_dispatch`-only file with the schedule removed. Step 6 above now
  requires deletion outright; a repo upgraded before that requirement
  existed is exactly the one still carrying the old, paused version.
- **Orphaned pack secrets and tokens** — a repository secret or `.env`
  reference for the old pack's sync credential (a `*_PACK_TOKEN`-shaped
  name) that nothing calls once the workflow above is actually deleted.
  Deleting the workflow without also removing the secret leaves a live
  credential with no reader, which is its own, separate risk.
- **A leftover `process/manifest_<pack>.json` or pack tree** the original
  migration didn't fully retire — re-run
  `python3 tools/precedent_decommission.py process/<old-pack-tree> process/manifest_<pack>.json`
  and don't consider the repo upgraded until it reports `CLEAR`.
- **Backlog or TODO items that assumed a schedule still existed** — an item
  about pausing, re-enabling, or monitoring the old scheduled sync is moot
  now that no repository runs one at all, and is safe to close as `DONE`
  and prune, distinct from a genuinely open item about the same pack.
- **A `process/retired_vocabulary.json` that predates the pack's own
  retirement**, or one that never existed because the original migration
  predated [migration-scrubs-vocabulary](../practices/migration-scrubs-vocabulary.md)
  itself. Add the pack's name and any retired secret name to `terms` if
  they aren't there yet, then run
  `python3 tools/precedent_check.py --only retired-words`
  and don't call the upgrade done until it passes.

None of this is a second migration — the three-source model is already in
place — it is closing out exactly the piece the 2026-09-14 decision changed
out from under an earlier migration's own correct-at-the-time step 6.

## The default-branch gotcha

**Since 2026-09-25 this section does not apply to an ordinary install.**
Every install follows `main`, which is BestPractice's default branch, so the
pin and the default are the same branch and `checkin.py update` is the route.
An install still recording `staging` or `precedent-beta-v01` is repointed to
`main` by the engine refresh itself (since 2026-09-27), never by hand
([vendor-update-runbook](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md) steps 1 and 4). What
follows is for a repo deliberately pinned to some other branch.

**Still follow the manual steps below.** What changed is *why*, and the
distinction matters for how long they stay: this used to be a limitation of
the tool, and is now a deliberate hold while the fix settles.

**What it was.** `tools/checkin.py`'s `fresh`, `update`, `record` and
`push` all resolved the **remote's default branch** unconditionally
(`_default_branch()` reads `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`) — there was no way
to say "track this named branch instead." A repo doing exactly what this
document describes — beta-testing a not-yet-merged branch, as
the project's own prior notes repository did against `precedent-beta-v01` — could not use these
commands for that branch: `fresh` reported "moved" every single session
(comparing the pinned branch's commit against `main`'s HEAD, an unrelated
lineage), and an unattended `update` run would have merged `main`'s tree
over the deliberately-pinned vendored copy — deleting content, not
updating it.

**What is true now, 2026-09-06.** All four commands read `upstream.branch`
from the repo's own `process/manifest.json`, falling back to the clone's
default only when no pin is recorded — the field this document already told
you to add is now the field the code reads. `record` also stopped checking
the source clone out from under its caller. Seven cases in
[tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py) assert both
properties, each with a negative control.

**Why the steps below have not changed anyway.** They exist to stop an
*unattended* job overwriting a vendored tree, and the fix above is hours
old at the time of writing. The two ways of being wrong are not the same
size: relaxing this too early costs a silent overnight wipe of a repo's
practices, and staying cautious costs a stale paragraph. Morgan's call —
record that the pin works, keep the manual procedure, revisit once the fix
has run through real sync cycles. Treat this as **not yet**, not as
*cannot*, and do not flip it on your own: relaxing it is a decision with an
owner, tracked as
[TODO.md's `relax-the-pinned-branch-hold` item](../todo/todo-2026-09-06-relax-the-pinned-branch-hold.md).

**The hold is enforced, since 2026-09-07 — it is no longer only written
here.** `checkin.py update` refuses outright while `upstream.branch` names a
branch other than the clone's default, printing the manual procedure below.
The refusal condition *is* the hold's own condition, so it retires itself:
when the pinned branch merges into the default and a repo's
`process/manifest.json` is repointed, the guard stops firing
with nothing to remember to delete. Override for one run with
`checkin.py update ... --allow-pinned` — or the equivalent
`PRECEDENT_ALLOW_PINNED_UPDATE=1`, kept for scripts and harnesses that don't
mind it. **Prefer the flag**: reproduced 2026-09-17 against a real
pinned-branch consumer, the env-var form gets refused outright
by Claude Code Web's own permission classifier before checkin.py ever
runs — the name matches its "safety bypass flag" heuristic (`ALLOW`
overriding a hold) closely enough to read as one, so every pinned-branch
consumer running under that harness hit the refusal on every Update Vendors
pass and had to fall back to the manual mirror below instead. The flag
carries no such name and isn't classified that way. Ten cases in
[tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py) assert the hold and
both spellings of the override, with a negative control.

**What that guard cannot reach, and why the manual mirror is still the entry
point.** A consumer still carrying a *pre-fix* vendored copy of
[tools/checkin.py](../tools/checkin.py) has no guard in it — that copy
resolves the remote's default branch unconditionally and would mirror the
default over a deliberately-pinned tree, a silent wholesale revert. A guard
shipped inside the tree it guards is missing from precisely the copies that
need it, the same shape as the freshness-guard incident in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)'s gotchas. Such a repo is protected only *after*
one manual mirror brings the current file in. So: mirror by hand first, and
the tool defends the pin from then on.

**Handle it explicitly, don't let it surprise the next sync:**
- Do the vendor as a one-off manual mirror (replace the tree wholesale from
  a checkout of the named branch), not `checkin.py update` — which now
  refuses anyway, rather than leaving this to be read and remembered.
  **"Replace" is load-bearing, and copying over the top is the way it goes
  wrong.** `checkin.py update` deletes every vendored file the source no
  longer has; a hand-run `cp -a` cannot express a deletion, so a document
  upstream has since renamed stays behind under its old path and reads as
  live. A real consumer accumulated twelve such files across four manual
  mirrors between 2026-09-06 and 2026-09-07 — three root documents that had
  moved under `documentation/` and `spec/`, three renamed how-to guides, two
  renamed specs and a whole renamed template tree — every one of them a
  superseded copy a session could have opened and believed, and nothing
  reported any of it. Remove the directory and lay the archive down fresh.
- Record the branch name in `process/manifest.json` (add an `upstream.branch`
  field; the schema doesn't have one by default, but the field costs
  nothing and every subsequent session needs to see it) alongside a `_note`
  explaining why automated sync is paused and when to lift it.
- Delete the sync workflow's `schedule:` block, leaving `workflow_dispatch`
  for a manual run, with a header comment pointing at the same note, and
  guard any unattended prompt text so a manual trigger stands down rather
  than silently assuming default-branch semantics.
- **Nothing gets re-enabled.** This bullet used to read *"re-enable once the
  branch merges to the default branch and `process/manifest.json` is
  repointed there"*, which made the schedule a pause. **Superseded
  2026-09-14:** no repository runs a scheduled vendor update at all, so
  repointing the manifest lifts the *pin*, not a clock. The replacement
  channel is a person saying `Update Vendors`
  ([vendor-update-runbook](../practices/vendor-update-runbook.md)).

## A real finding: the scrub check has no notion of "already public upstream"

Running `practice_audit.py`'s scrub check against a repo whose owner is
*also* a disclosed, named contributor to BestPractice/Precedent itself (not
a hypothetical — this is exactly that repository's situation, and exactly
why the check surfaced it) can fail on content that isn't actually a leak:
the owner's real identity, disclosed on purpose in BestPractice's own
public docs narrating the real work of populating the private sets, happens
to match that owner's own private-repo blocklist entries for the same
identity, entered there to protect a *different*, unrelated context.

The scrub check's assumption — anything under `process/upstream/` should
already be public-safe because it mirrors a public repo verbatim — has no
way to tell "this term arrived already-public, disclosed by upstream
itself" apart from "this term leaked in via a local edit or a bad merge."
Both the blocklist and the check are working as designed; they weren't
designed for one person occupying both roles at once. Weakening a
blocklist entry to silence this would also weaken it against the failure
mode it actually exists for.

**Not fixed here** — that repository's own record documents it as an
accepted, understood FAIL for that specific vendored tree rather than
something to patch around. The shape of a real fix: scrub the **diff**
against the last-recorded upstream commit, not the whole snapshot every
time — the same move `tools/leak_gate.py`'s push-time check already made
(walking a commit range rather than scanning a working tree), for the same
reason (a snapshot scan can't distinguish "always been there, already
disclosed" from "just arrived"). Worth a proper fix in `practice_audit.py`
itself; flagged here rather than attempted, since it touches a checked-in
gate every dependent repo relies on and deserves its own pass, not a
side-effect of a migration writeup.

## Known gap this migration ran into — closed 2026-09-03, read this for what changed

**This section used to say the cross-source consumer-repo view was
unbuilt, and that step 7 above hand-curates a stopgap because of it.**
That's no longer true, and the fix corrects a framing this document itself
had slightly wrong, not just a missing feature.

`precedent_show.py`, `precedent_paths.py`, and `precedent_gate.py` — the
three loading channels that pull a slug's `## Rule` text into context
automatically — are still single-source, and stay that way on purpose:
each hardcodes its own repo as `ROOT` and only ever reads
`<that repo>/practices/`. **The fix was never to make these three
multi-source-aware.** It was to materialize a real, ordinary,
single-source `practices/` directory *from* the multi-source resolution,
and point these same, unmodified tools at that — which
[tools/precedent_materialize.py](../tools/precedent_materialize.py)
already did, tested, before this gap was even written down (phase 5); the
gap this document originally named was really that nobody had connected
that tool to `build_views.py`'s own `AGENTS.md` generation in one
documented, consumer-facing command.

That connection is [tools/precedent_sync_views.py](../tools/precedent_sync_views.py)
now: `python3 tools/precedent_sync_views.py --repo DIR` (required — from the
repo root, `--repo .`) resolves every
declared source, materializes the merged `practices/` + `tools/checks/`,
and regenerates `AGENTS.md`'s loader block from the *same* resolved
practices (not re-read from disk) — one command, in place of step 7's old
hand-curated stopgap below.

**Finishing this surfaced a real bug, not just a missing convenience.**
`precedent_materialize.py` deletes and rewrites the output `practices/`
directory; a repo-local source declared at the bare repo root
(`path: "."`, this document's own earlier examples) has its own
hand-authored `practices/` at exactly that same path. Materializing into
a repo that also self-sources at its own root either crashed (reading a
file the tool had just deleted) or, worse, silently overwrote a
hand-authored file with a different source's winning content the moment
another source shadowed a repo-local slug — reproduced directly, not
theoretical. Fixed two ways: `precedent_materialize.py` now reads every
source file into memory before deleting anything, so the crash and the
silent-overwrite-with-no-trace case are both gone; and repo-local's
`path` is now required to be a subdirectory (`"local"`, holding
`local/practices/`), which keeps the hand-authored source and the
materialized output physically apart regardless. **2026-09-04 addendum:**
`path: "."` no longer resolves at all for a repo-local source —
`tools/precedent_resolve.py`'s `load_config` refuses anything but
`path: "local"` outright, closing the gap this paragraph originally left
open (a recommendation a repo could still ignore). See
[CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md](CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md)'s 2026-09-04 entry.

Tested against a real four-source fixture, not just reasoned about
(`check_sync_views_cross_source` in
[tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py)); now also run
against a real consumer repo with real content
(a private consumer repo, 2026-09-03) — see the next section for
what that run found.

## Two real bugs this pattern's first real run found — closed 2026-09-03

That private consumer repo's migration (2026-09-03) is this pattern's
first end-to-end run against a real dependent repo with real content, not
a fixture. It surfaced two real bugs in the tooling itself, both now
fixed, both worth naming here so the next migration doesn't have to
rediscover them:

1. **`tools/precedent_check.py`'s `ROOT` resolved to the wrong repo once
   vendored.** `ROOT = pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]` is
   correct when this file runs self-hosted at this repo's own `tools/`,
   but wrong once vendored into a dependent repo at
   `process/upstream/tools/precedent_check.py` — that layout resolves
   `ROOT` to `process/upstream/` itself, not the dependent repo's real
   root. A check meant to scan the *consuming* repo's own tree —
   `migration-scrubs-vocabulary` is the one that actually surfaced this —
   silently scanned `process/upstream/`'s own tree instead when invoked
   exactly as this document's own step 5 says, and reported a false-clean
   `SKIPPED` (no `process/retired_vocabulary.json` inside
   `process/upstream/`, correctly, since none belongs there) rather than
   ever seeing the dependent repo's real files. Fixed: `ROOT` now resolves
   via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, the same resolution `doc_lint.py`
   and `practice_audit.py` already used for the same reason, which is
   correct in both the self-hosted and vendored layouts without needing to
   know which one it's in.

2. **`process/retired_vocabulary.json`'s `exempt_files` had no way to
   exempt a directory**, only exact file paths. That's fine for a repo's
   own hand-authored documents, but a *materialized* directory (this
   repo's own `practices/`, filled in by `tools/precedent_materialize.py`
   on every `precedent_sync_views.py` run) holds *other* repos' own
   content — including, in the migrating repo's case, a shared-source
   practice file's own `approved_by` frontmatter citing **its own**
   provenance ("migrated from RepoPersonalPreferences...", true of that
   *source's* history, unrelated to the migrating repo's). The migration
   declared `RepoPersonalPreferences` as a retired term and the check then
   failed on every one of those materialized files — a directory the
   migrating repo doesn't author and can't hand-exempt file-by-file
   without the list going stale the next time materialization adds or
   drops a slug. The same thing happened again with `PERSONAL_PACK_TOKEN`:
   this file's own [`migration-scrubs-vocabulary` practice](../practices/migration-scrubs-vocabulary.md)
   uses that exact string in its own Story section as its illustrative
   example of "a retired secret name" — a different repo's history
   (the project's own prior notes repository's), not the migrating repo's, but the same
   literal substring, materialized into `practices/` the same way. Fixed:
   an `exempt_files` entry ending in `/` now exempts a whole directory
   (see the pattern's own step 5 above, and the practice file's Detail
   section) — reach for it only for a materialized directory, never as a
   shortcut around a repo's own hand-authored tree.

Neither bug was in the migration pattern itself; both were in tooling the
pattern depends on that had never been exercised against real content
before. That's exactly why this document keeps asking a migrating session
to validate for real (step 8) and report back what looked wrong, rather
than treating a clean run as proof the machinery is correct.

## A third real bug — this document's own step 7, incomplete — found 2026-09-06

Unlike the two above, this one was in the pattern itself, not in tooling
it depends on. the project's own prior notes repository followed step 7 exactly as
written and ended up with a repo that could load practices but not check
them: `tools/precedent_check.py` was simply absent, because step 7's file
list (the nine engine files plus `routing_scope.json`, all handled by
`precedent_vendor_engine.py --kind consumer`) never named it —
`precedent_check.py` is deliberately excluded from that tool's scope (a
separate enforcement channel, not the loader), and the step's prose never
said so or told the reader to handle it another way. The gap was silent
until someone actually tried to run a check: `precedent_gate.py` fails
loudly (`FileNotFoundError` on the missing `routing_scope.json`, in this
case not the cause but caught the same way), while a missing
`precedent_check.py` just means the enforced channel doesn't exist —
nothing errors, there is simply nothing there to catch anything. Fixed
two ways the same session: step 7 named `precedent_check.py` explicitly as
a required, separate hand-copy; and (tracked in [TODO.md](../TODO.md)) a
mechanical check now scans every vendored engine file for hardcoded
`ROOT / 'tools' / '<name>'` paths and flags any that don't exist locally —
the same class of gap this one was, caught structurally instead of by a
downstream crash.

**Fixed a third way on 2026-09-06, which is the one that actually closes
it**: `precedent_check.py` is in `CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES`, so the vendoring
step brings it. A required hand-copy documented in prose is a step a
migration can skip, which is what this incident was; the point of the
vendoring tool is that nothing about the engine depends on remembering.
The same pass found three more files in the same position — `doc_lint.py`,
`doc_sync.py` and `routing_audit.py`, each named by a universal practice's
own check — plus `precedent_source_bootstrap.py`, which the
individual-source session hook execs and whose absence was swallowed
silently at both call sites.
