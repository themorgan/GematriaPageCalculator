summary:       "TODO.md and the gotchas index both capture mechanically and drain by hand, so both only grow. This is the specification for the replacement: one item is one permanently-named file, typed by kind, dated in its name, with every list generated rather than hand-kept — including a native, date-gated Reminders mechanism with no scheduled trigger — plus the ordered migration plan for this repo and for every repo that vendors this format."

# Open Items and Gotchas: The New Format and Migration Plan

**Nothing here is implemented.** This is a specification to review, not a
report of work done. It replaces an earlier draft that argued its way to
these decisions; that argument is not repeated here — only the result.

## The Problem, in One Paragraph

[TODO.md](../TODO.md) and the gotchas index both fill up by a mechanical
trigger — a merge, a mistake — and empty out only when a person happens to
prune them. Nothing expires on its own. [TODO.md](../TODO.md) is 114 items,
77 still open, and over half the file by volume is items already done that
nobody removed. The gotchas index went from 5 entries to 42 in two weeks. Both
problems have the same shape, so both get the same fix.

## The Fix, in One Paragraph

**One item is one file. The file is created once, is named for what it is and
when it was first noted, and never moves or gets renamed again.** Everything that
changes about the item — whether it's done, who it's waiting on, how strongly
it was decided — is a field inside the file, not a change to its name or
location. Every list a person reads (open items by kind, all open decisions,
gotchas due for a look) is generated from those fields on demand, the same way
[MAP.md](../MAP.md) is generated from `practices/*.md` today. Nothing is ever
hand-sorted into a list that can drift from the truth.

## Part 1 — The Open-Item Format

### Directory and Naming

```
todo/todo-2026-09-14-source-set-push-triggers.md
```

- **Directory:** `todo/`, replacing [TODO.md](../TODO.md).
- **Filename:** `todo-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`. The date is the day the item was
  first noted, at the front, so the directory sorts oldest-first with no tool
  involved (`ls todo/` alone shows age).
- **The `todo-` prefix is mandatory and marks the file as non-binding.**
  A practice file ([practices/verify-postcondition.md](../practices/verify-postcondition.md)) has no prefix,
  because a bare slug in this repository means a rule in force. `todo-` and
  `gotcha-` (below) exist so a slug like `cleanup-old-list-items` can never be
  misread as a practice: the unmarked namespace is the one that binds, and
  everything else says so in its own name.
- **The filename never changes after creation.** Closing an item, reassigning
  it, or changing how strongly a decision was made — none of these rename or
  move the file. Every link to it stays valid forever.

### Frontmatter

## What
## How It Closes
## Notes
```

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | matches the filename, no `.md` | the item's permanent identity |
| `kind` | `analysis` \| `verify` \| `manual` \| `decision` | what KIND of work closes it — see **The Four Kinds** below |
| `domain` | `content` \| `mechanism` \| `null` | is this about the actual deliverable (a practice, a document) or about the machinery that manages it (a check, a hook, a workflow) — see **Domain** below |
| `severity` | `blocking` \| `notable` \| `minor` \| `null` | optional; how much this matters, for sorting the unblocked-work view — the first field to drop if the frontmatter gets too heavy |
| `status` | `open` \| `done` \| `dropped` | is it finished |
| `disposition` | `wait` \| `ask` \| `parked` | unchanged from [open-item-disposition](../practices/open-item-disposition.md) — whether a session may raise it unprompted |
| `remind_on` | `YYYY-MM-DD` or `null` | the day an `ask` item becomes eligible to surface unprompted — `null` means eligible immediately (today's behavior), a date makes it a Reminder — see **Reminders** below |
| `blocked_on` | free text or `null` | the stated reason it isn't done now — required unless `status: open` and `kind: analysis` with no blocker, which is itself a finding (see Part 3) |
| `batch` | free text, or `null` | groups items that are really one job, so they can be swept together — never "project," which this repository (and GitHub itself, via Projects boards) already uses for something else |
| `decision` | free text, or `null` | for `kind: decision` items only — what was decided, in prose, written when `status` becomes `done` (see **When an Item Closes** below) |
| `decision_strength` | `strong` \| `weak` \| `assented` \| `null` | only set where the item records an approval — see **Decision Strength** below |
| `waiting_on` | a person's name, or `null` | who has to act next — a **label**, not a filing location, and not necessarily the person who will eventually do the work (see **Why Kind, Not Waiting-On** below) |
| `noted` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | the day this was first written down; must match the date in the filename, checked mechanically — **not** the day anyone reads or reopens the file. Where the true date is unknown, this is a floor (earliest known), and the file's own `## Notes` says so — see **Every Item Has a Date** below |
| `closed` | `YYYY-MM-DD` or `null` | when `status` became `done` or `dropped` |

### The Body Sections

Three, always, in this order:

- **`## What`** — what the item is, written once, rarely touched again.
- **`## How It Closes`** — the static condition: what has to be true for
  `status` to become `done`. This is `blocked_on` elaborated in prose.
- **`## Notes`** — an append-only, dated log. **Any session whose work
  touches this item without closing it adds a line here** — what it found,
  what it did, what changed. This is
  [item-closes-on-its-condition](../practices/item-closes-on-its-condition.md)
  given an actual place to write: that practice says work bearing on an item
  gets recorded into it, and until now nothing in the old format said
  *where*. A line looks like:

  ```
  2026-09-16: confirmed the API still returns the old shape; blocked_on unchanged.
  ```

  Notes are never edited or removed, only appended — the log is the point.

### The Four Kinds

This is not a new taxonomy — it already exists, unused, in
[templates/TODO.md.template](../templates/TODO.md.template). This format is
the first thing to actually use it.

| `kind` | Meaning | Closes when |
|---|---|---|
| **`analysis`** | Work a session can do from its own desk — read code, write code, run a check, write a document. | A session does the work. |
| **`verify`** | A claim that needs checking against something outside this repository — a live API, another repo's real state, a platform's current behavior. | The check is run and the result is recorded. |
| **`manual`** | Needs a person to actually DO something this session cannot — hardware, a vendor, a real end-to-end rehearsal. | The person does the thing. |
| **`decision`** | Needs a person to CHOOSE between options this session has already laid out. | The person decides. |

`manual` and `decision` are easy to confuse and worth separating cleanly:
`decision` is closed by a choice; `manual` is closed by an action. "Which
naming convention should we use" is a decision. "Run this on real hardware
and report what happened" is manual, even though a person is doing both.

**Why kind, not waiting-on, is the filing axis:** an earlier draft of this
plan filed items by "who can clear it" and got it wrong in the same breath —
four of five groups named a kind of work, not a person, and the one group
that did name a person ("Alex needs to decide this") was sometimes wrong
about which person. `waiting_on` is kept as a field precisely because it
needs correcting without anyone renaming a file. `kind` doesn't have that
problem: whether a task is analysis, verification, a manual action, or a
decision is a fact about the task, and it doesn't change hands.

### Domain

A second, independent axis: is this item about the actual deliverable, or
about the machinery that manages the deliverable?

| `domain` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **`content`** | The item is about the thing itself — a practice's wording, a document's accuracy, a missing piece of the catalogue. |
| **`mechanism`** | The item is about the tooling, checks, hooks, or workflow that build, enforce, or ship the content. |
| **`null`** | Genuinely both, or neither — not every item needs a domain. |

**Why this isn't folded into `kind`:** `kind` says what closes an item;
`domain` says what it's about. A `content` item and a `mechanism` item can
both be `kind: analysis` — "fix this practice's wording" and "fix this
check's bug" are both a session doing the work from its desk, and knowing
that is useful independently of knowing which one it is. Cramming both facts
into one field would mean either doubling `kind`'s values (eight instead of
four) or losing one axis. Keeping them separate keeps `kind`'s meaning exact.

### Severity

Optional, and the field most likely to be cut if the frontmatter proves too
heavy in practice:

| `severity` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **`blocking`** | Something else can't proceed until this closes. |
| **`notable`** | Worth attention, not urgent. |
| **`minor`** | Low cost either way. |
| **`null`** | Not assessed. |

Severity decays faster than `kind` or `domain` — what's blocking today may
not be next week — so it's the one field a session should feel free to leave
`null` rather than force a guess on. It exists for one purpose: letting the
unblocked-work view (Part 1, **Generated Views**) sort by something other
than age.

### Every Item Has a Date

**No item is ever dateless.** Every `todo/*.md` and `gotchas/*.md` file
carries a real date in its name, always — this is a hard rule, not a
default that some items opt out of.

**No dedicated field for precision.** An earlier draft carried
`noted_precision: exact | at-or-before` for this, and on review it isn't
worth a permanent field: the distinction matters for exactly one thing — the
batch of items migrated in with no true creation date — and every item
created from this point on has an exact date by construction (a session
creates the file today, dates it today). A field that is `exact` on every
future file forever, to serve a fixed, shrinking batch of legacy ones, is
the wrong trade.

**Instead: the file's own `## Notes` carries the caveat, once, at
migration.** For the items being migrated in whose anchor is already present
at the earliest commit this repository's history reaches — so the honest
statement is *at or before that date*, not a specific day — the filename
still uses that floor date (a name must be assigned; it's a lower bound, not
a guess), and the migration writes one line into `## Notes`:

```
2026-09-16: noted date is a floor, not exact — this item predates anchor
tracking and its true creation date is unknown. Migrated from TODO.md.
```

The generated index shows age the same way for every item, computed
straight from `noted`. For the legacy batch this slightly overstates
precision in the index; anyone who needs the caveat finds it in the one
place that actually states it, rather than the whole schema carrying a
field that means something for a few dozen files and nothing for the rest.

### When an Item Closes

**The file never moves.** Nothing in this format ever moves once created —
closing an item is a change to its fields, not to its name or location.

Setting `status: done` (or `dropped`) also sets `closed` to that day. For a
`kind: decision` item, it also sets `decision` — one or two sentences of
prose recording what was actually decided, written into the file, not left
implicit in the fact that `status` flipped.

**This repository also keeps [decisions/](../decisions/)** — a
longer-standing, higher-ceremony ledger for decisions with lasting,
citable weight, unrelated to this format and not being changed by it. The
two aren't duplicates: a `kind: decision` todo item answers "was this
settled," and a `decisions/` entry is "here is the record other documents
point back to." Most closed decisions need only their own `decision` field.
A decision significant enough to warrant the second treatment gets both —
same as today, where a session writing a `decisions/` entry is already a
separate, deliberate act.

### Decision Strength

**Settled 2026-09-16 (`decided`): extend the universal
[decision-strength](../practices/decision-strength.md) practice, not just
this format.** Raised in the prior review as reopening a question that
practice's own Story appeared to record as already settled, against it — a
three-or-five-level scale "considered and rejected" for inviting a session to
split hairs about someone's state of mind. **Put to the person the citation
was about, the citation didn't hold up**, and re-reading the Story confirms
why: every other claim in it is a direct quote — *"if I say things imply
it's a test..."*, the cue table — but the scale-rejection sentence carries
none. It's the session's own reasoning, written in the session's own voice,
with nothing attributed. Exactly the thing
[decision-strength](../practices/decision-strength.md) itself warns about:
*"Unmarked is neither. It may be cited as what the repository records, and
not as what the person wanted."* A claim about a rejection, unmarked, cited
back nine days later as if it had been decided — is a small, live example of
the very failure this whole document exists to prevent, caught by the person
it was attributed to rather than by any check.

**The vocabulary itself is also revised, from review.** `decided-strong` /
`decided-weak` next to a bare `assented` puts two of three values in one
naming pattern and the third in another. Fixed by moving the shared idea into
the field's name instead of repeating it in every value:

**Field key `decision_strength`, unified across the universal practice and
this format — the same key, the same values, everywhere.** Not just the
same vocabulary under two different keys (the prior draft's `strength:` /
`decision_strength:` split) — one key. Values: `strong` \| `weak` \|
`assented` \| `null`.

**Sized, so the migration is understood before it runs:** `strength:`
appears in the frontmatter of **23 practice files**, and as an inline
citation in **49 files repo-wide** — `TODO.md` alone carries roughly two
dozen. It is a *universal* practice, vendored into every dependent
repository and all four attached practice sets, so it propagates the way the
`todo`/`gotchas` format itself does (Part 4.2). Unifying the key means the
migration touches the key as well as the values — a marginal cost on top of
a pass the vocabulary change already requires, not a second pass.

**The migration is a rename, not a re-judgment — the distinction that keeps
it from violating the practice's own anti-backfill rule.**
[decision-strength](../practices/decision-strength.md) refuses to backfill
strength onto old *unmarked* approvals, because guessing a past state of
mind is exactly what
[no-invented-specifics](../practices/no-invented-specifics.md) forbids. This
migration doesn't do that — nothing in it requires a new judgment about the
past:

- **Every existing `strength: decided` becomes `decision_strength: strong`.**
  The practice's own definition of `decided` — *"they asked for it, chose it
  from options you laid out, or pushed back and the thing landed where it
  landed"* — already describes conviction. Relabeling it is mechanical, not
  a new read of anyone's state of mind.
- **Every existing `strength: assented` becomes `decision_strength:
  assented`.** Value unchanged, key renamed.
- **`weak` is forward-only.** Nothing in the historical record was ever
  assessed against a category that didn't exist, so nothing is reclassified
  into it. It starts being used the day this lands, for a "sure, I guess"
  that today gets written down as a plain `decided`/`strong` it wasn't.

**In this format**, `decision_strength` is the identical field — not a
refinement or a superset, the same vocabulary. It is set only on items that
actually record an approval; most items are findings nobody approved, and
writing a decision strength on those would be recording an approval that
never happened. It is set going forward, when an item is touched, never
backfilled in bulk against old items.

### Reminders

**A Reminder is an `ask` item with a date it becomes eligible.** Nothing new
in the schema beyond one field:

```yaml
disposition: ask
remind_on:   2026-10-01
```

`remind_on` (`YYYY-MM-DD` or `null`) is the day an `ask` item may start being
surfaced unprompted. Before that day it behaves like `wait` — recorded, and
no session raises it. On or after it, it behaves like a normal `ask` item:
eligible, not mandatory, exactly as
[open-item-disposition](../practices/open-item-disposition.md) already
governs every other `ask` item.

**Every Reminder has a date — this is a hard rule, the same shape as "every
item has a date" in **Every Item Has a Date** above.** `remind_on: null` is
legal, and means *not a Reminder*: an ordinary `ask` item, eligible the
moment `disposition` is set, exactly as today. **Where the person doesn't
name a date, `remind_on` defaults to `noted`** — the day the item was
written — which reproduces today's behavior exactly (eligible immediately)
while still satisfying the rule that a Reminder always carries a real date,
never an absent one standing in for "sometime."

**This extends [todo-reminder](../practices/todo-reminder.md), rather than
replacing it — one thing changes, the rest is preserved on purpose.** That
practice already establishes the two things this format keeps word for
word:

- **"It is a reminder, not a deadline. Nothing fires on a schedule."** This
  is not a new principle for this document to invent — it's already the
  rule, and `remind_on` doesn't change it. `remind_on` sets *earliest*, not
  *when*; nothing runs at that timestamp, because nothing runs on a timer
  at all. A Reminder is still only ever surfaced by a session that happens
  to be working here, at a moment that session already reaches for
  independent reasons.
- **The two places that look stay the two places that look**:
  [three-things](../practices/three-things.md), which weighs marked items
  when answering "Three Things," and the closing **Next Steps** section
  [next-steps-after-commit](../practices/next-steps-after-commit.md)
  already requires on every committing reply. A due Reminder is exactly the
  kind of outstanding item that section exists to surface; this document
  doesn't add a third channel, it gives the two that already exist
  something dated to filter on. (A consumer's own practice sources may
  narrow *where in that section* an unrelated item is allowed to appear —
  that's a layering question for that source, not something this format
  needs to settle.)

**What's actually new: eligibility is computed, not manual.**
[tools/todo_progress.py](../tools/todo_progress.py) lists every
`**Remind:**`-marked item unconditionally today, with no date test — any
session skimming that output sees a reminder set for six months out mixed
in with one due today. The generator built for this format
(**Generated Views** below) adds a **Due Reminders** view: every
`disposition: ask` item where `remind_on` has arrived, and only those. A
Reminder not yet due doesn't appear there at all — it's in the file,
findable, simply not yet eligible to interrupt anyone.

**Explicitly not built on a scheduled trigger — this is the part worth
stating firmly, because the natural engineering instinct is to reach for
one.** No `CronCreate`-style job, no GitHub Actions scheduled workflow, no
external push of any kind checks whether a Reminder has come due. The
mechanism is **pull, not push**: a generated view a session reads because
it's already reading the repo, the same way `todo/TODO.md`'s other
sections are read. This is what "native to Precedent" means in practice —
the reminder mechanism is a fact about committed files and existing session
touchpoints, the same substance as everything else in this document, not a
piece of infrastructure bolted on beside it. A scheduled trigger would also
contradict the practice this extends: "nothing fires on a schedule" is
already the rule, and a `CronCreate` job checking for due reminders would
be exactly that, wearing a different name.

**Creating one:** saying "Todo reminder" — the existing command, unchanged
— writes or updates a `todo/*.md` item with `disposition: ask` and
`remind_on` set together, in the same turn, mirroring
[todo-reminder](../practices/todo-reminder.md)'s own "both lines, not one"
rule exactly: setting one field without the other leaves an item that is
either an ordinary `ask` with no reminder behavior, or a date with nothing
telling a session it may act on it. **The content goes in `## What`, in the
person's own words** — no separate `**Remind:**` line is needed in this
format, because `## What` already is that line; a Reminder is not a
different kind of item, only an `ask` item with a date.

### Generated Views

**Settled 2026-09-16 (`decided`): closed items get their own file, never
mixed into the same list as open ones.** Stated plainly in review as the
thing that actually mattered about today's `TODO.md` — 37 of its 114 items
are done and still crowd the file everyone reads. A "Done" section at the
bottom of the same generated file doesn't fix that; the file is still the
size of everything ever written. **Two generated files, not one:**

**`todo/TODO.md`** — `status: open` items only. Same familiar name as
today's root-level file, now inside the directory it indexes, generated the
way [MAP.md](../MAP.md) is from `practices/*.md`. Its own first line says
so, so nobody mistakes it for something to hand-edit:

```
<!-- GENERATED by tools/build_todo_index.py — do not edit. Edit the item
     files in todo/ instead; this file is rebuilt from their fields. -->
```

It carries at minimum:

- **One table per `kind`**, with `domain` and `severity` as columns.
- **A table per `batch`**, for items that are really one job — this is
  where "source-set work," "engine defects," and the rest of the
  Appendix's classification live now: each is a `batch` or a `domain`
  value, not a hand-maintained file. The classification stays useful
  without becoming a physical file someone has to keep in sync.
- **Age**, computed from `noted`, sorted oldest first.
- **Unblocked work** — every `open`, `kind: analysis` item with no
  `blocked_on`. This is the list that should be closest to empty.
- **Open decisions** — every `open`, `kind: decision` item, the one list a
  person is actually asked to read regularly.
- **Due Reminders** — every `open`, `disposition: ask` item whose
  `remind_on` has arrived. Not yet due doesn't appear here at all
  (**Reminders**, above); this is the section
  [three-things](../practices/three-things.md) and the closing
  **Next Steps** section actually read from.

**`todo/CLOSED.md`** — every `status: done` or `status: dropped` item, one
line each, newest first. Generated the same way, for the same reason: a
hand-kept closed-items file would need pruning too, just of a different
kind of error (someone forgetting to add a line rather than forgetting to
remove one). Nobody reads this file routinely; it exists so a closed item
is still findable without living where an open one would be seen.

**This also resolves the "which classification" tension directly**: the
per-subject grouping (source-set work, engine defects, and so on) survives
as *views computed from fields already in the schema* — `batch`, `domain`,
`kind` — rather than as a second axis of physical files that could drift
from `todo/decisions.md`, `todo/unblocked.md`-style hand-kept alternatives.
One open-items file, computed from real data, sectioned the useful way.

A hand-kept file drifts the moment a `blocked_on` clears and nobody moves the
item. A generated view can't drift, because it's rebuilt from the fields
every time — this is the whole reason the format is a directory of small
files with fields, rather than a bigger hand-edited document.

## Part 2 — The Gotcha Format

Same shape, adapted to what a gotcha is: a trap recorded so the next session
doesn't rediscover it, not a piece of unfinished work.

### Directory and Naming

```
gotchas/gotcha-2026-09-13-shallow-clone-reads-as-diverged.md
```

Same rule as `todo-`: dated, prefixed, permanent once created.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
slug:            gotcha-2026-09-13-shallow-clone-reads-as-diverged
status:          live
noted:           2026-09-13
severity:        notable
retired:         null
retires_when:    null
---
## Symptom
## Story
## Fix
```

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | `live` \| `retired` | replaces the separate [record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md](../record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md) file — a retired entry is the same file, `status` flipped, never moved |
| `severity` | `blocking` \| `notable` \| `minor` \| `null` | optional, same three values as the open-item format — here it means how costly the trap is when hit, not how urgent it is to fix |
| `retires_when` | free text, or `null` | the condition under which this entry stops being worth a session's attention — declared in the schema now, **populated later**; see below |

### `retires_when` Is Declared Now, Built Later

Today nothing states what would retire a gotcha; an entry is archived only
when a person happens to re-read it and judge it dead. The field is part of
the schema from the start — so no gotcha file needs a second migration later
— but it is **not populated as part of this migration**. Writing it on the
42 live entries, and wiring the sweep in Part 3 to read it, becomes the
first real `kind: analysis` item filed in the new `todo/` system once it
exists — a fitting first use, and a small, well-scoped task rather than
something this migration has to carry.

When it is built, three shapes should cover nearly every case:

```
retires_when: "a mechanical check refuses this — <name the check>"
retires_when: "the harness fixes <specific behavior>; re-test whenever
               the harness changes that behavior"
retires_when: "nothing has hit this since <date> and the mechanism
               that caused it no longer exists"
```

### Generated View

**Superseded 2026-09-16 (`decision_strength: strong`) — see Decisions below.**
This subsection originally kept the gotcha index inside
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) exactly as it stood pre-migration: one line per
live entry, symptom plus link, loaded every session, generated from
`gotchas/*.md` instead of hand-kept. That premise did not survive contact
with the measured cost: the index alone reached 1,736 tokens across 44
entries, loaded whole every session regardless of whether that session ever
touched a trap. The generated view now lives at `gotchas/INDEX.md` — the
same one-line-per-live-entry content, the same source fields — but it is
**not** `@`-included anywhere and nothing loads it by default.
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) carries a short pointer instead: search
`gotchas/` by symptom keyword before concluding a failure is new
(practice: `grep-before-search`), with a link to `gotchas/INDEX.md` for the
deliberate read. `retires_when` is still not shown in the generated view
once it's built, for the reason already stated: it's for whoever is
auditing the catalogue, not for every session.

---

## Part 3 — The Two Sweeps

Both are additions to `python3 tools/very_deep_check.py`, run on request, not
on a schedule — this repository has no mechanism for "review this
periodically," and adding one is out of scope here.

**Open-item sweep.** Reads every `todo/*.md` and reports, without closing
anything:
- Every `open`, `kind: analysis` item with no `blocked_on` — these should
  either be done now or have a real reason written down.
- Every item whose `blocked_on` names something that no longer exists.
- The oldest few items by age.
- **Every Reminder whose `remind_on` is well past** — a safety net, not the
  primary mechanism. `todo/TODO.md`'s Due Reminders view (**Generated
  Views**) is what a session normally reads; this is what catches one that
  arrived and nobody happened to be working here to see it.

**Gotcha sweep.** [tools/very_deep_check.py](../tools/very_deep_check.py)
already has a gotcha-currency pass that follows the index into the record and
reads the bodies (120-day staleness threshold, measured, not assumed). It's
extended to read `retires_when` and report entries whose condition looks met.

Neither sweep closes or retires anything on its own —
[item-closes-on-its-condition](../practices/item-closes-on-its-condition.md)
already puts that judgment on a person or the session doing the work, and a
heuristic auto-closer would undo it.

## Part 4 — Migration Plan

### 4.1 — This Repository

Ordered; each step is independently useful, so nothing is wasted if a later
step is deferred.

1. **Fix the already-broken references first.** `TODO.md` is cited by number
   in prose in five tool files ([tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py),
   [tools/verify_harness.py](../tools/verify_harness.py), and others) — these numbers shift on every
   insert and are wrong today, independent of anything else in this plan.
   Repoint them to anchors.
2. **Prune done items out of `TODO.md`.** Under the new format these become
   `status: done` files; under the old format, moving them out is the same
   work either way, so do it now rather than migrating dead weight.
3. **Delete the visible numbers from `TODO.md`.** Nothing can then be cited
   by a number that's about to stop meaning anything.
4. **Write the frontmatter schema and the generator as real code** —
   `tools/todo_migrate.py` (one-time, item-by-item conversion) and
   `tools/build_todo_index.py` (ongoing, run the way [tools/build_views.py](../tools/build_views.py) is).
5. **Run the migration.** Every live item in `TODO.md` becomes a
   `todo/todo-<date>-<slug>.md` file. Every entry in
   [record/GOTCHAS.md](../record/GOTCHAS.md) and
   [record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md](../record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md) becomes a
   `gotchas/gotcha-<date>-<slug>.md` file, `status: retired` for the archived
   ones. Every item with no true creation date gets its floor date and the
   one-line `## Notes` caveat (**Every Item Has a Date**). **The 5 items
   `TODO.md` already marks `**Remind:**` become Reminders**: `disposition:
   ask`, `remind_on` set to that item's `noted` date (an old `**Remind:**`
   carried no date of its own, so the honest mapping is "eligible
   immediately," which is what it already was under
   [todo-reminder](../practices/todo-reminder.md)'s pre-date behavior — not
   a new date invented for it). The migration commit includes a full
   old-slug → new-filename mapping table.
6. **Repoint every existing reference** using that mapping table
   ([rename-updates-links](../practices/rename-updates-links.md)) — the
   `TODO.md#slug` links, the `#gN` gotcha anchors, everywhere they appear in
   `spec/`, [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), and practice files.
7. **Add a check that fails on a stale reference** — a link to `TODO.md#x`,
   a bare `#gN` anchor, or an `item N` phrase, anywhere in the tracked tree,
   from this point on. Without this the migration decays within a week.
8. **Wire the two sweeps into `very_deep_check.py`** (Part 3), last, because
   they read fields the migration creates.
9. **File `retires_when` on the 42 live gotchas as the new system's own first
   `todo/` item.** Not part of this migration (Part 2, **`retires_when` Is
   Declared Now, Built Later**) — its natural home is the system it will run
   in.

**`domain` and `severity` are not required at migration time.** The migration
script sets `kind`, `status`, `noted`, `blocked_on`, `waiting_on`, and
`disposition` from what the old item already states — those are read off the
existing text. `domain` and `severity` are left `null` on every migrated item
rather than guessed at for 114 items in bulk; a session sets them when it
next touches an item, the same rule as `decision_strength`.

### 4.2 — Dependent Repositories

This format lives in [templates/TODO.md.template](../templates/TODO.md.template)
today, which every adopting repository instantiates — so this plan is not
this repository's alone. **There is no single old format to convert from**:
measured across the four attached practice sets, one has a `TODO.md` with
4,344 words and zero anchors, one has three numbered items, and two have no
`TODO.md` at all.

The sequence for a dependent repository:

1. **This repository ships the finished template and tooling first** — the
   frontmatter schema, `tools/todo_migrate.py`, `tools/build_todo_index.py`,
   and the stale-reference check, all vendored the way the rest of the engine
   is.
2. **Each dependent repository migrates from a session rooted in it**, running
   `tools/todo_migrate.py` against its own `TODO.md` (or starting a fresh
   `todo/` if it has none) — never migrated from this repository on the
   dependent's behalf, since only a session rooted there can see what that
   repository's items actually mean.
3. **A repository with no `TODO.md` today just starts using `todo/`** — there
   is nothing to migrate, only the template to adopt.

### 4.3 — What Does Not Migrate Automatically

**Gotchas are this repository's own environment lore and do not travel to
dependent repositories the same way.** [record/GOTCHAS.md](../record/GOTCHAS.md)
describes traps in *this* codebase's tooling; a dependent repository's own
environment gotchas (if it keeps any) are a separate, repository-local
collection under the same format, not a copy of this one's.

### 4.4 — Migration Is Not One Moment: Ordinary Work Doesn't Stop for It

**The cutover in 4.1 is a single commit; the migration isn't.** Every step
above assumes `TODO.md` holds still long enough to convert. It won't. This
repository runs many branches and sessions in parallel, and, as of
2026-09-16, `precedent-beta-v01` is expected to stay deliberately out of
sync with `main` for days or weeks more. Ordinary PRs keep merging into
`precedent-beta-v01` throughout that window and after it, and some of them
will add a new item to `TODO.md` the old way — a branch forked before the
cutover, a session that hasn't seen this document, a check-in PR from a
dependent repository that hasn't migrated yet (4.2). **A plan that only
covers the cutover moment will be stale again within a week of landing**,
the same failure this whole document exists to fix.

**The fix is a rule for ordinary merging, not a bigger one-time step.**

1. **A tenth step, appended to 4.1's list:** extend the stale-reference
   check from step 7 so it also fails on *new* content added to `TODO.md`
   after the cutover commit — not a bare presence check (the file may need
   to exist briefly as a redirect stub), a check on the diff. A PR that
   tries to add an old-format item is refused at the same gate that already
   catches a stale `#gN` anchor; it names `todo/` as where the item belongs
   instead. This is what actually holds the line — a rule stated in prose
   gets missed by the one PR that predates it, a check does not.
2. **A line added to [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)'s existing "Working in this
   repo" section** — where the repository's routine-merge instructions
   already live, right beside the note about carrying commits from `main`
   and the check-in-PR review convention — the moment 4.1 actually runs:

   ```
   - **A pull request touching `TODO.md` after the todo/ migration is
     refused by CI.** File the item under `todo/` instead
     (spec/OPEN_ITEM_AND_GOTCHA_PLAN.md).
   ```

   This is documentation, not enforcement — the check in step 1 above is
   what actually stops a bad merge. The line in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
   is what tells a person *why* it was refused and where to look, since a
   red check with no pointer just gets retried.
3. **Check-in PRs from a dependent repository get the same treatment as any
   other PR** — reviewed against the same gate, per the existing
   second-scrub-line convention in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)'s "Working in
   this repo." A dependent repo's own migration timeline (4.2) is its own
   business; what it sends here still has to land in the format this
   repository has already moved to.

---

## Part 5 — Cost, and What Was Deliberately Left Out

**Per-item overhead goes up, and this revision made it heavier.** A one-line
open item becomes a file with fourteen frontmatter fields. Four of them
(`domain`, `severity`, `decision`, `decision_strength`) are optional and can
sit `null`, so the mandatory core is closer to the original ten — but every
field in the schema is a field a reader scans past on every file, whether or
not it is set. The median live item today runs to a few hundred words, where
this costs nothing; the shortest is under thirty words, where the frontmatter
is most of the file. Taken anyway, because the alternative — one file no tool
can slice, that every session reads in full — is worse at the current and
growing size (114 items, 42 gotchas). `severity` (see Part 1) is named
explicitly as the field to cut first if this proves too heavy in practice.

**Left out of this plan on purpose:**

- **A scheduled review.** The sweeps in Part 3 run on request
  ([very-deep-check](../practices/very-deep-check.md)'s own standing rule),
  not on a timer. This repository has no periodic-schedule mechanism, and
  building one is a separate decision.
- **Hand-kept files, subject-divided, instead of generated ones.** A
  variant considered and dropped in review: `todo/decisions.md`,
  `todo/unblocked.md` and similar as real, hand-visible files divided by
  subject. Two problems, not one: a hand-kept file whose `blocked_on` has
  cleared lies until someone moves the item, and a subject division doesn't
  hold still — an item can be both a decision and unblocked work. Resolved
  by computing the subject views from fields instead (**Generated Views**
  above); the closed/open split survives because it maps onto `status`,
  which every item unambiguously has exactly one value of.
- **Auto-closing items or gotchas from a sweep.** Both sweeps report only;
  closing stays a human or an active-session judgment
  ([item-closes-on-its-condition](../practices/item-closes-on-its-condition.md)).
- **Populating `retires_when` on the existing 42 gotchas now.** Deferred to
  a follow-up item filed in the new system itself (Part 4.1, step 9).

---

## Decisions

All three settled 2026-09-16. Kept here, past tense, as the record of what
was decided and how firmly — not as a checklist to work through.

1. **`decision_strength: assented` — the rule for items with
   `kind: analysis`, `status: open`, and no `blocked_on`.** Fix it now if
   fixing it doesn't materially expand the scope of the work already in
   front of you; if it does, file it properly — a real `todo/` item,
   `severity` actually set rather than left `null` — instead of leaving a
   vague note. The open-item sweep (Part 3) then does what it already does
   for everything else: it *reports* items sitting unblocked with nothing
   happening to them; a person or a session reads that report and decides,
   case by case, whether to act. **This also corrected a contradiction in
   the previous draft**, which said the sweep itself "closes anything left
   with no stated blocker" — Part 3 is explicit that neither sweep closes
   anything on its own, and that stays true here too. What actually creates
   pressure isn't an auto-closer; it's that unblocked, unfixed work becomes
   visible every time the sweep runs, rather than invisible inside 114
   items nobody re-reads.
2. **`decision_strength: strong` — closed items live in their own
   generated file, never interleaved with open ones.** Stated as the actual
   problem with today's file: 37 of 114 items are done and still crowd
   every read. `todo/TODO.md` now carries `status: open` items only;
   `todo/CLOSED.md` is a second generated file for everything `done` or
   `dropped`. **The subject classification survives as computed sections
   inside `todo/TODO.md`** — `batch`, `domain`, and `kind` already carry
   that information, so "source-set work" and "engine defects" are views
   over the real fields rather than a second set of hand-kept files that
   could drift from them. Full detail in Part 1's **Generated Views**.
3. **`decision_strength: strong` — the migration runs in two passes, with a
   review between them.** Steps 1–4 of §4.1 first (fix the broken
   references, prune done items, delete the visible numbers, build the
   migration tool and the generator) — nothing here touches a real item
   yet. **Stop. Spend a few minutes reviewing** — and specifically, run the
   migration tool against a handful of real items and read its output by
   hand before step 5 runs it against all 114 items and 42 gotchas and
   repoints every reference. That's the one step in this plan that isn't
   cheap to undo, so it's the one worth a deliberate look at real output
   first, not just a read of the plan. If that looks right, continue
   straight through steps 5–10 in the same session — no reason to
   introduce a second pause once the tool has proven itself on real data.

   **Step 5 itself — "run the migration" — is announced by name when it
   starts, separately from the pause above.** The pause after step 4 is a
   review of a dry run; step 5 is the moment the real, mostly-irreversible
   conversion actually happens, against every live item and gotcha at
   once. Whoever is executing this plan says so explicitly — *"starting
   step 5 now: converting all 114 items and 42 gotchas"* — right before
   running it, and reports the result right after. This is a requirement
   of the plan, not a courtesy left to whoever happens to be driving:
   written here so a session with no memory of this conversation still
   knows to do it.
4. **`decision_strength: strong` — the gotcha index moves out of AGENTS.md
   too, not just the stories.** Morgan, 2026-09-16, directly: *"can we
   change how the gotcha system works so that they're only loaded when
   needed?"*, after establishing that Part 2's original "Generated View"
   premise — one line per live entry, loaded every session — was exactly
   what had grown a still-unsplit dependent repository's inline gotcha
   stories to ~20,000 tokens, and that BestPractice's own already-split
   index was headed the same direction at a smaller constant (1,736 tokens,
   44 entries, no ceiling of its own). Superseded the same day: see Part 2's
   **Generated View** above for what replaced it, and
   [tools/session_load_budgets.json](../tools/session_load_budgets.json)'s
   `AGENTS.md` entry for the measured before/after. Not yet rolled out to
   that dependent repository — Part 4.3 already says gotchas don't migrate
   cross-repo, so its own split (inline stories into its own `gotchas/`,
   plus this same AGENTS.md-pointer treatment) is separate, follow-up work
   in that repository, on request.

## Appendix — Item Classification, Measured 2026-09-14

The table below classifies the 57 items that were open on 2026-09-14, by the
five kinds of work found in the file at that time — evidence for why the
`kind` field above is the right axis, not a live count. **The repository has
moved since** (114 items as of this writing, up from 91); re-run this
classification against the current file before using it to plan actual
migration work.
### The 57, Classified

Each row links the item. `Since` is the first day its anchor appears in the
file's history; `Words` is how long the item has grown.
