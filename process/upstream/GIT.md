# Git, minimally, for this way of working

## Why GitHub at all?

A normal chat thread is useful but temporary. Important context may be
buried in an old conversation, known to only one person, or missing from
another assistant's memory. Keeping the project in a GitHub repository
gives the team a shared, inspectable memory instead:

- Important decisions are written down.
- Everyone works from the same current information.
- Earlier versions can be reviewed or restored.
- Several people can work without silently overwriting one another.
- A new person or AI session can understand the project by reading its
  map and asking questions.
- Changes record what happened and why.
- Rules that matter are enforced by automatic checks, not by reminding
  people.

The repository is the memory. The chat is the way you work with it.

GitHub is the worked example throughout these documents, and BestPractice
currently leans on GitHub features (pull requests, Actions checks)
deliberately. The layer itself is plain git, markdown, and Python, so
equivalents on other hosts such as Gitea can be added later — see
[TODO.md](TODO.md).

## The eight ideas

You don't need to know git deeply to use [BestPractice](README.md); you
need eight ideas. (Throughout: a "repo" is short for repository — the
project's shared folder on GitHub; a "session" is one AI conversation; a
"commit" is one saved change with a note about what and why.)

- **The default branch (`main`) is the shared truth.** It is what every new
  session reads for orientation. Nothing is "real" until it lands there.
- **Each thread works on its own branch** — a private copy of the repo where
  a session (or a person) can make any number of commits without disturbing
  anyone else. Two threads on two branches never conflict *while working*;
  reconciliation happens once, at merge time, under fixed rules the
  project's instruction files set out.
- **Branch work is invisible to everyone else until it lands on `main` —
  and they catch up.** Publishing takes two steps: your branch must be
  *merged* into `main`, and then each collaborator (human or agent session)
  must *pull* the updated `main` into their own copy. Until both happen,
  don't expect others to see your work — a pushed branch technically exists
  on the server, but nobody working from `main` will encounter it. The same
  holds in reverse: someone else's unmerged branch is invisible to you,
  which is why "it's not in the repo" really means "it's not in `main` yet."
- **A pull request (PR) is a reviewable bundle of changes** — "here is
  everything branch X wants to add to main," shown as a side-by-side
  comparison of before and after. If several people (or several agent
  threads) touch the same repo, PRs are where a second pair of eyes goes:
  you can ask a colleague, or another agent session, to review a branch
  before it merges. For a solo repo, PRs are optional — merging directly
  is fine; the project's automatic checks are the real safeguard either
  way.
- **Permissions decide who may merge.** On a repo someone else owns, you may
  find you can push branches and open PRs but not merge them — the owner
  reviews and merges on their schedule; that's normal, not an error. The
  same lever works for you in the other direction: when your repo gains a
  second contributor, you can require that all changes to `main` go through
  a PR that only you approve and merge (on GitHub: repo Settings →
  Branches → a branch protection/ruleset on `main` requiring pull requests
  before merging). Contributors then work freely on branches while every
  change to the shared truth waits for your review — a good default the
  moment a repo stops being solo.
- **History is permanent.** Every commit is recoverable, so bold edits are
  safe: anything can be diffed against any earlier state and reverted. This
  is what makes "the repo is the memory" trustworthy — memory that can't be
  silently lost or rewritten.
- **One agent can work on branches of several repositories at once.**
  Nothing about git or agents limits a session to a single repo: give it
  access to two (or more) repositories — on GitHub, each repo the agent's
  app installation is permitted to touch; in the Claude Code app
  specifically, you pick which repos the session can access when you
  create it — and it can hold a branch open in each and commit to all of
  them in one conversation. This is not a BestPractice feature, just a
  practical fact coding tools take for granted that matters here: it is
  how **cross-cutting work** gets done — moving content from one repo to
  another, reorganizing which repo owns what, keeping a shared layer in
  sync across repos. This repo's own improvement loop is the worked
  example: one session generalizes a lesson learned in a private project
  repo and lands it here, in a single thread.
- **An agent session's repo access is fixed when the session starts.** On
  hosted agent platforms, a session can write only to the repo(s) you
  selected when creating it. A session opened on one repo can usually still
  *read* a public repo (copy it, compare against it) but cannot push
  branches or open PRs there — writes fail even though reads work, which
  is confusing the first time you hit it. So decide up front: if a session's
  plan includes pushing to a second repo (the check-in step in
  [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) §4, for example),
  **select both repos when you create the session** — you generally can't
  add write access mid-session.
